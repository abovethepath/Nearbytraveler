That last line is the whole problem:
EADDRINUSE 0.0.0.0:5000 = something is already running on port 5000, and your dev server is trying to start a second listener on the same port (often because you already have one npm run dev running, or Vite + API are both trying to bind to 5000).
Here’s the fastest way to fix it (pick the path that matches where you’re running this):
If this is Replit


Stop the current running process




Click Stop (square button) in Replit (or stop the existing “Run” tab).




Make sure there isn’t a second “Run” still alive




Replit sometimes leaves a prior process alive if you opened multiple tabs or restarted weirdly.


If there’s a “Shell”: run:


lsof -i :5000

If it shows a PID, kill it:
kill -9 <PID>



Start again:


npm run dev

If this is Render / Railway / production hosting
In production, you generally must not hardcode port 5000. Hosts assign a port via process.env.PORT.
In your server/index.ts (or wherever you call listen), do this:
const PORT = Number(process.env.PORT) || 5000;
server.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on ${PORT}`);
});

Then redeploy.
✅ This prevents EADDRINUSE when the platform expects you to bind to its port.
If this is local (Windows / Mac)
Run one of these to see what’s using 5000:
Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5000

Windows (PowerShell)
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

Then kill it:
Mac/Linux
kill -9 <PID>

Windows
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

A very common root cause in your setup
Your logs show:


API server starts


then “Setting up Vite development server…”


then crash on listen :5000


That often happens when:


your API server is already listening on 5000 and


Vite dev server (or a second node process) is also configured to use 5000, or


you started npm run dev twice (super common in Replit/Cursor/preview setups).


Quick safe fix: move Vite off 5000
In vite.config.ts, set:
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 5173,
    strictPort: true,
  },
});

Keep your API on 5000, keep Vite on 5173.

What I’d do right now (most likely to work for you)


Stop everything (Replit Stop button or kill the PID).


Start clean once: npm run dev


If it still happens, change Vite to 5173 as above.


If you paste the part of your server/index.ts where you call listen(...) and your vite.config.ts server section, I’ll tell you exactly which one is binding to 5000 and the minimal edit to stop the conflict.
