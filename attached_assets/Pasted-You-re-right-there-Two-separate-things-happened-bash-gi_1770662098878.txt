You’re right there. Two separate things happened:

bash: git: command not found — that was from a weird pasted command (the ^[[200~ bracketed paste junk). Ignore it.

Your real issue now is this line:

modified: attached_assets/vite.config.ts

So you edited the wrong file. You updated a copy of vite.config.ts inside attached_assets/, not the real one at the project root.

Render uses the root one:
/home/runner/workspace/vite.config.ts

Do this exactly (no extra thinking)
1) Confirm the real file exists at root
cd /home/runner/workspace
ls -l vite.config.ts

2) Open and edit the RIGHT file

In Replit file tree, click vite.config.ts (top level, not inside any folder) and paste your updated config there (the one with dedupe + css.postcss).

3) Stage the correct file (and optionally undo the wrong one)

Run:

cd /home/runner/workspace
git add vite.config.ts


Now check:

git status

If it still only shows attached_assets/vite.config.ts modified

That means you still haven’t edited the root file.

To undo the accidental change in attached_assets:
git restore attached_assets/vite.config.ts

4) Commit + push
git commit -m "Fix Vite PostCSS resolution for Render"
git push

Why it says “ahead of origin by 1”

You already have one local commit ready to push, but your new changes aren’t staged/committed yet.

After you commit the right file, git push will publish everything.

Quick shortcut if you don’t want to hunt in the UI:

Replace the root config from shell by copying the file you edited (if it’s correct):

cd /home/runner/workspace
cp attached_assets/vite.config.ts vite.config.ts
git restore attached_assets/vite.config.ts
git add vite.config.ts
git commit -m "Fix Vite PostCSS resolution for Render"
git push


That’s the fastest “no clicking” route.

Once pushed, go to Render → Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit.

you are fiucking pissing me off, i am not fucking up everything in mysite, what the duck is going on here

You’re not fucking up your site. What’s going on is way dumber than that:

What happened (in plain English)

You have two copies of vite.config.ts in your Replit workspace:

✅ The real one Render cares about:
/home/runner/workspace/vite.config.ts

❌ A random extra copy sitting in attached_assets/vite.config.ts
(this is basically a junk/backup copy Replit or something created)

You edited the junk copy, so Git is saying:
“Hey, you changed this file… but that’s not the one that controls your build.”

Nothing about your actual site is “getting ruined” — it’s just pointing at the wrong file.

The fastest fix (one command sequence, no guessing, no UI clicking)

Copy/paste this whole block into the Shell:

cd /home/runner/workspace

# copy the correct config into the real file
cp attached_assets/vite.config.ts vite.config.ts

# undo the accidental change in attached_assets so it doesn't pollute your repo
git restore attached_assets/vite.config.ts

# commit and push the real change
git add vite.config.ts
git commit -m "Fix Vite PostCSS resolution for Render"
git push


That’s it. This will:

put your updated config in the right place

remove the accidental change in the junk file

push to GitHub so Render can rebuild

If the last line still won’t push

Then you’ll get a clear error message. Paste it and I’ll tell you the single next command.

You’re not breaking your site — you’re cleaning up a stupid duplicate file situation.
