You’ve got a stray )} still in client/src/pages/profile.tsx, which is why Vite says:

ERROR: The character "}" is not valid inside a JSX element  (line ~3779)
…
3777 | </CardContent>
3778 | </Card>
3779 | )}   ← this is the culprit


That )} is trying to close a conditional you opened earlier with something like:

{isSomething && (
  <Card>…</Card>
)}


…but the way it’s placed now, the parser sees the )} as raw characters inside a JSX parent node → boom.

Fix it now (2-minute surgical)

Open client/src/pages/profile.tsx and go to ~3770–3785.

Delete the line with )} that follows </Card> (the one your log shows at 3779).

Find the matching opener for that block above: it will look like {<condition> && (

Change it to remove the parenthesis, so it becomes:

{condition && <Card>…</Card>}


In other words, convert this:

{condition && (
  <Card>…</Card>
)}


to this:

{condition && <Card>…</Card>}


That eliminates the dangling ) you’re closing with )} at the bottom.

Why this works

Inline && with a single JSX node doesn’t need parentheses, so there’s no trailing ) to accidentally end up outside the right spot. The parser stops complaining because there’s no raw )/} left “inside” a tag’s children.

Quick sanity sweep (catch any siblings or leftovers)

At the same area (~3810 lines each side), make sure any conditional + following <div> are wrapped:

Bad

{showX && <div>…</div>}
<div className="mt-4">…</div>   // ← sibling without wrapper


Good

<>
  {showX && <div>…</div>}
  <div className="mt-4">…</div>
</>


Make sure there are no other stray closers right around there:

Search and delete any </form>, </Form>, or </DialogContent> that don’t have matching openers in the same block.

Re-run

Just save the file; Vite will recompile. If another error pops up, it will point to the next spot. Apply the same pattern:

Convert {cond && ( … )} → {cond && …} for a single node, or

If there are multiple siblings, wrap them in <>…</> (or <FormItem>…</FormItem> if inside a shadcn FormField render).

Paste the next error line (file:line + 3 lines around it) if anything else trips and I’ll call the exact lines to change.
