Yep — this code is correct. If it’s still 1 column, the problem is not in this snippet. It’s one of these “environment / override” issues. Here’s how to pinpoint it fast (and fix it decisively):

1) Prove whether the container is actually display: grid

Add a screaming debug border + background right on that exact div:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-2 border-4 border-red-500 bg-red-500/10">


If you don’t see the red border → you are not rendering the element you think you are (different component/state).

If you do see it → inspect it in DevTools and check Computed → display.

If display ≠ grid, then something is overriding it.

2) Force the grid with !important (this immediately reveals class conflicts)

If Tailwind classes are being overridden by a flex somewhere (often from a wrapper class), this fixes it:

<div className="!grid !grid-cols-2 md:!grid-cols-3 lg:!grid-cols-4 xl:!grid-cols-5 gap-2">


If this works, you’ve confirmed: some other class is overriding grid.

3) The most common real cause: you’re viewing it on a “md+” width but it’s still “xs” due to scaling

If you’re testing inside an iframe/webview/zoomed container, your viewport may be under md, so you’re expecting 3–5 cols but seeing 2.
But you said you’re seeing 1, so this is less likely.

Still: add a temporary grid-cols-2 only (no breakpoints) to make sure:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">


If it’s still 1 → it’s definitely override (#1/#2).

4) Child items spanning full width (rare but happens via inherited styles)

Even though your UserCard doesn’t have col-span-*, a wrapper inside UserCard might be applying it conditionally elsewhere.

Quick test: add this to the button:

className="w-full min-w-0 max-w-none col-span-1 ..."


Also try removing w-full temporarily:

className="min-w-0 max-w-none ..."


w-full usually doesn’t break grid, but if something weird is happening with the layout, this exposes it.

5) You have global CSS that changes .grid (this happens more than people think)

Search your repo for ".grid" in CSS. If any stylesheet contains:

.grid { display: flex; }


or any reset library doing something insane, it will nuke Tailwind’s .grid.

Search terms:

grid {

.grid {

display: flex

grid-template-columns

6) It’s in a wrapper state (compact mode / layout switch) in home.tsx

Your snippet passes compact={isCompactMode} — I’m betting there’s conditional layout above that changes the container you’re actually seeing.

Search home.tsx for:

isCompactMode ?

compact

flex

grid

className={

A very common pattern:

<div className={isCompactMode ? "flex flex-col" : "grid grid-cols-2 ..."}>


…and you’re in compact mode, so you get 1 “column”.

The fastest path to the answer

Do these two things:

Change the container to:

<div className="!grid !grid-cols-2 gap-2 border-4 border-red-500">


Tell me what you observe:

Do you see the red border around the user cards?

In DevTools → computed styles on that element: what is display?

With that, I can tell you exactly where the override is coming from and what line to change.
