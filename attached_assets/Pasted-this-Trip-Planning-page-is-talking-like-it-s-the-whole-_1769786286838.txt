this Trip Planning page is talking like it’s the whole matching engine, but in your new flow it’s really just Step 1: set destination + dates, then Step 2: City Plans is where matching intent gets specific. So the page copy + fields need to match that reality.

What to change (simple, high-impact)
1) Fix the promise + redirect (most important)

After “Create My Trip Plan” succeeds:

Auto-redirect to: City Plans for {Destination}

Show a toast/banner:
“Trip created! Next: choose 3–8 City Plans to match faster.”
Button: “Go to City Plans →”

On the page itself (above the form):
Replace the “fill out as detailed as possible…” with:

Step 1 of 2: Create your trip
Destination + dates get you into the right city.
Next, you’ll pick City Plans (things you want to do) to match with the right people.

2) Reduce “Traveler Type” clutter

That big checklist is too much friction and includes stuff people won’t self-label (budget/luxury).

Replace it with 2–4 lightweight inputs:

Required

Destination (city)

Dates

Optional (keep it simple)

Who are you traveling with? (Solo / Couple / Friends / Family) (you already have this)

What are you looking for? (Meet locals / Meet travelers / Both) (super helpful for matching)

Trip pace (Chill / Balanced / Packed) (harmless + useful)

Everything else can be moved to City Plans or Profile later.

3) Reframe “budget/luxury” as non-judgmental

If you still want that signal, don’t ask “Budget Traveler.”

Use:

Spending comfort: Value-focused / Mid-range / Treat-yourself
or

Typical plans: Free/cheap activities / A mix / Premium experiences

Make it optional and don’t surface it loudly.

4) Make City Plans the “matching” step

Under the submit button (or in a right-side panel on desktop), add a preview:

Next: City Plans (2 minutes)

Pick 3–8 things you want to do in {City}

We’ll use those to show your best matches

You can edit anytime

5) Rename the page/title for clarity

Your header “Plan Your Next Adventure” is fine marketing, but the functional page title should be:

Create a Trip
Subheader:

“Destination + dates. Then choose City Plans.”
