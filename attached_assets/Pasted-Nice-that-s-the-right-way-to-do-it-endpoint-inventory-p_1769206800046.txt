Nice — that’s the right way to do it (endpoint inventory → prompt coverage). If your prompt is now “feature-complete,” the only things I’d still verify/add are the failure modes + mobile-specific gotchas that tend to break Expo/RN even when endpoints exist.

The 10 things worth verifying (highest ROI)
1) Cookie sessions on RN + CORS headers (the #1 real-world break)

Verify these three in practice (not just in prompt):

Set-Cookie: connect.sid=...; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None (SameSite is the usual killer on mobile)

CORS includes: Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true and a non-* origin

RN fetch/axios actually persists cookies across app restarts (via @react-native-cookies/cookies)

Test: login → kill app → relaunch → call GET /api/auth/user (must still be 200, not 401).

2) WebSocket auth reliability on iOS

Even if cookies work for HTTP, WS cookie-handshake often fails in native.
Verify: you can successfully connect to wss://nearbytraveler.org/ws and receive messages after:

cold start

background → foreground

network drop → reconnect

If you support auth message on open (you do), confirm server behavior when sessionId is missing and you only send userId.

3) Pagination + “infinite scroll” expectations

Most endpoints will be unusable on mobile without paging.
If your backend supports it, verify and document:

limit, offset or cursor-based params for: users search, events, messages, chatroom messages, deals, photos, itineraries

deterministic sort order (createdAt desc, etc.)

If paging doesn’t exist, add it ASAP or you’ll ship a slow/crashy app.

4) Consistent error shapes + status codes

Builders get confused unless you standardize:

401 unauthenticated

403 blocked/forbidden

404 not found

422 validation errors (field-level)

If your backend returns multiple formats, add a “normalizeErrors()” rule in the prompt.

5) Upload formats (multipart vs base64) — pick one canonical

You already noticed this conflict earlier.
Verify each upload endpoint expects multipart or JSON base64 and lock it:

profile photo

customer photos

event images

business images

Also verify max file size, supported types, and whether uploads return the new URL immediately.

6) Timezone + “date-only” fields (subtle bug source)

Anywhere you have start/end dates (travel plans, itineraries, deals, events):

verify whether backend treats them as midnight UTC, or true timestamps

confirm client must render local timezone and avoid “off-by-one day” on date-only UX

7) Blocked user enforcement across all surfaces

You said blocking/reporting is confirmed working — still worth verifying these queries exclude blocked users:

discovery/search

city chatrooms + event chatrooms

DMs

quick meetup participants lists

referrals/auto-connect

On mobile, this shows up as “why am I seeing someone I blocked?” which is App Store review poison.

8) Notification preferences: does backend actually honor them?

If you now have notification settings endpoints:

verify push triggers respect settings (DMs, connection requests, event RSVP, quick meetup nearby, deal alerts)

verify “quiet hours” if supported

confirm token invalidation / logout behavior

9) Deep links (calendar, external events, referral QR)

If you want itinerary/calendar + imported events + referrals to feel native:

define the exact deep link patterns (nearbytraveler://event/123, .../city/Paris, .../ref/ABC123)

verify links work from Safari + QR scan + calendar event URL

10) App Store compliance checklist baked into prompt

Add explicit “must ship” items so the builder can’t miss them:

in-app report user and block user flows

in-app account deletion request (or a WebView that lands on the exact delete page)

Terms/Privacy links in Settings

location sharing opt-in defaults OFF + foreground-only updates

One meta issue: prompt length risk (1848 lines)

Replit builders can “forget” early constraints when prompts are huge. The best fix is structure:

Add a top section that says:

“If any ambiguity, prefer Appendix response shapes. Do not invent fields.”

“Implement in phases: Phase 1 smoke test must pass before adding Phase 2+.”

And move low-priority features (secret experiences, external imports, itineraries, customer photos) into an “Expansion Modules” section so the core build doesn’t collapse under complexity.

If you want me to sanity-check one thing, pick this

Paste one real response payload (redacted) for:

/api/auth/user (post-login)

/api/search-users?...

a WebSocket message event you actually emit

Those three determine whether the app can authenticate, render discovery, and do realtime — everything else is downstream.
