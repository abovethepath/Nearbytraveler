i am worried my ability ot monitie nearby traveler to businesses is weak, i think we need to find out more detials of a persons trip that is monatixable, thoughts? like the interests and activites questions we ask to match people, should be data we collect that we can sell to a business
Thought for 15s

You’re thinking about the right thing: businesses don’t really pay for “a list of users.” They pay for intent + timing + location + measurable results.

The move isn’t “sell personal data.” The move is: collect trip signals (with consent), then sell targeting + placement + attribution inside Nearby Traveler.

What businesses will actually buy
1) Targeted reach (ads/deals that hit the right traveler right now)

Example: “Couples in Venice Beach this weekend who like live music and cocktails.”

2) Leads / bookings (pay per action)

“Reserve a table”

“Claim deal”

“Message business”

“Buy tickets”

“Add to calendar”
Businesses love paying for actions because it’s tangible.

3) Insights (aggregated, not personal)

“Next 30 days: 2,400 travelers in LA interested in comedy + nightlife; peak days Thu–Sat; most common neighborhoods: Santa Monica / DTLA.”

That’s valuable without exposing anyone.

The monetizable trip details to collect (high-value “intent signals”)

You already collect interests/activities. Add trip context that’s business-useful:

Trip basics

Purpose: leisure / work / conference / family visit / solo exploration

Travel party: solo / couple / friends / family (+ companions count like “2 adults + 2 kids”)

Dates + flexibility: exact vs flexible

Neighborhood / area of stay: pick 1–3 areas (way more useful than “LA”)

Spend / willingness

Budget range (simple): $ / $$ / $$$ (or “value / mid / premium”)

Splurge categories: “fine dining”, “shows”, “experiences”, “shopping”, “nightlife”

Timing + behavior

Typical going-out times: mornings / afternoons / evenings / late night

Weeknight vs weekend preferences

How far will you travel locally: walk / 10 min / 30 min / “anywhere”

Constraints (this drives conversion)

Dietary: vegetarian, halal, gluten-free, etc.

Accessibility needs

“Kid-friendly required” toggle

Smoke-free preference

Immediate intent (gold for monetization)

Ask 2–3 questions that identify ready-to-buy behavior:

“What are you most likely to book in the next 48 hours?” (dining / nightlife / tours / events)

“Are you celebrating something?” (birthday / anniversary / bachelor/ette)

“Any ‘must do’ plans this trip?” (top 1–3)

These are directly monetizable because businesses can target and convert quickly.

How to collect it without feeling creepy
Make it optional + user-benefit framed

Instead of “we collect data,” say:

“Help us personalize deals and recommendations in your area.”

“You control what’s shared with businesses.”

Use toggles

✅ “Show me relevant deals from local businesses” (default on, but clear)

✅ “Share my trip profile with businesses” → Off by default

Always allow: “Don’t use my data for targeting.”

Keep it segmented

Businesses don’t need identity. They need segments:

“Families staying near Santa Monica this week”

“Nightlife lovers within 2 miles tonight”

That’s powerful and safer.

What you “sell” to businesses (clean positioning)

Instead of “we sell traveler data,” your pitch is:

“We deliver high-intent travelers to your business, and you only pay when it works.”

Business portal features:

Audience targeting (interests + trip context + neighborhood + dates)

Create deal/event

Choose radius + time window

See analytics: impressions → clicks → claims → redemptions

Optional “message travelers” only after a traveler opts in

If you want one killer monetization feature

Trip-mode deals:
When a traveler is in a city during their dates, businesses can bid to show:

“BOGO tonight”

“Happy hour within 0.5 miles”

“Family-friendly lunch special”
…and you track redemption.

This is easy for businesses to understand and ties directly to revenue.

If you want, I’ll write:

the exact trip questions (10–12 max) in your tone,

the privacy wording for users, and

a simple business pricing menu (e.g., $200/mo base + pay-per-lead add-on) that fits your current model.

i meant like should we ask users, "pickleball", "gym" where i can marekt to a picklball court company or LA fitness, as opposed to asking  "outdoor sports" "excersize"
Thought for 18s

Yes — you should absolutely capture specific, purchasable intent like “pickleball” and “gym,” but you don’t want onboarding to turn into a 200-pill mess.

The sweet spot is: broad category for matching + specific sub-interest for monetization.

Best structure: broad → then drill down (only when relevant)

Ask the broad bucket first (fast, simple):

Exercise & Fitness

Outdoor Sports

Nightlife

Food & Drink

Live Music

Wellness

Family-friendly

etc.

If they tap Exercise & Fitness, immediately show a short drill-down:

Gym / weight training

Group classes

Yoga / Pilates

Running

Hiking

Pickleball

Tennis

Cycling

Swimming

So you’re not asking everyone about pickleball—only people who already said fitness.

Why this is ideal

Matching stays clean: you can match on “Exercise & Fitness” even if someone chose different specifics.

Monetization gets sharp: you can target “pickleball players in LA this week” (courts, leagues, tournaments, gear shops) or “gym-focused travelers” (local gyms, day passes, studios).

Less noise: most users won’t see niche options unless they want them.

What I’d do in your data model

Store both layers:

interest_category = Exercise & Fitness

interest_specific = Pickleball (optional)

That way a business can target specifics, but your product logic can still use broad signals.

Practical guidelines for your pill list

Keep “specifics” curated (top 10–20 per category)

Add a type-ahead search for long-tail (“pickleball,” “crossfit,” “F45,” etc.)

Let users pick Top 3 specifics max per category (prevents over-tagging)

What businesses can buy (without you “selling user data”)

You don’t sell identities. You sell segments and placements, like:

“Show this offer to travelers in LA between Feb 10–Feb 15 who selected Pickleball”

“Show this deal to people who selected Gym within 2 miles of Santa Monica”

(That’s how you keep it valuable and defensible.)

Copy that keeps it non-creepy

On the user side:

“Pick interests so we can match you with people and relevant local deals.”

Toggle: “Show me deals based on my interests” (on by default, but clear)

Never say “we sell your data”—say “we use your interests to show relevant offers.”

Quick example for your onboarding

Step: “What are you into on this trip?”
Buttons: Food & Drink • Nightlife • Exercise & Fitness • Outdoors • Arts
If they tap Exercise & Fitness → show: Pickleball • Gym • Yoga • Running • Hiking

If you paste your current Interests/Activities arrays (or the categories you already use), I’ll rewrite them into a clean hierarchy and flag which specifics are most monetizable for business partners.

What I’d do in your data model

It won’t be too intensive if you cap it and make it feel optional + fast. It will feel heavy if you force everyone through multiple screens or let drill-down explode into long lists.

Here’s the “keep it light” version that still gives you monetizable specificity.

The rule: 2 taps max

Goal: user should be able to finish interests in 10–20 seconds.

Flow

Screen shows broad buckets (8–12 max).
Prompt: “Pick up to 3 for this trip.”

Only if they pick a bucket, show a mini drawer with 6–10 specifics + a “Skip” button.
Prompt: “Want to get more specific? (Optional) Pick up to 2.”

That’s it. No multi-step wizard.

Make it optional and clearly beneficial

Copy matters:

“Optional: get better matches + better local deals”

“Skip” should be obvious and guilt-free.

Hard caps prevent shutdown

Broad buckets: pick up to 3

Specifics per chosen bucket: pick up to 2

If they choose 3 broad buckets, don’t force 3 drilldowns—either:

only drill down for the first one they tap, or

show a single “Add specifics (optional)” link later.

UI pattern that feels effortless

Use inline expand instead of a new page:

Tap “Exercise & Fitness” → expands right under it with pills: Gym, Yoga, Running, Pickleball…

Tap again collapses.

This feels like browsing, not a questionnaire.

Offer “Most Popular” so they don’t think

Inside each drill-down, show 6 popular ones first:

Gym, Yoga, Running, Hiking, Pickleball, Cycling
…and a tiny “Search” icon if they want more.

The trick: you can still monetize without everyone drilling down

Even if only 30–40% pick specifics, it’s enough.
Businesses can target:

Broad: “Exercise & Fitness travelers”

Specific: “Pickleball travelers” (higher conversion)

So you’re not betting the UX on everyone doing it.

A/B safety: add it gradually

Start with one drill-down category (Fitness) and see completion rate. If it doesn’t hurt onboarding, expand to others.

What success looks like

≥80% complete broad buckets

≥25–40% choose at least one specific

No drop in signup completion

If you show me your current onboarding step layout (one screen vs multiple steps), I’ll suggest the exact UI version that keeps it under 20 seconds and doesn’t feel like homework.
