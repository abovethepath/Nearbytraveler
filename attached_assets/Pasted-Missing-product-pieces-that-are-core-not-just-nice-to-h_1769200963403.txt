Missing product pieces that are “core” (not just nice-to-have)
1) Onboarding + profile completion flow

Right now you have “3 signup flows,” but you’re missing the real onboarding your web app is built around:

Step-by-step setup after signup: interests → hometown → destination + dates → preferences/demographics → profile photo/bio

“Incomplete profile” gating (e.g., you can’t appear in discovery until minimum fields are set)

2) Demographics + matching preferences (you mention them, but don’t define them)

You’ve repeatedly said people want to connect by demographics (ex: “girls want to meet girls”), but the prompt doesn’t define:

Which demographic fields exist (gender, age range, etc.)

Which ones are public vs private

Which ones are filterable in discovery/search

3) The “Super Calendar” experience

Your web vision includes a unified planning layer. The prompt has events + trips + quick meetups, but it’s missing:

A single calendar view that merges: my trip dates + events I RSVP’d + meetups + chatroom/event reminders

Add-to-calendar integration (Apple Calendar) and timezone display rules per event/trip

4) Third-party event integration (Meetup/Eventbrite/etc.)

Your broader product plan includes pulling events in. The prompt doesn’t mention:

Viewing “imported events” vs “community-created events”

Save/RSVP behavior for imported events

Source labeling + links-out (and how to keep it App Store compliant)

5) City homepage / city experience

You’ve talked about city pages as a key navigation concept. Mobile prompt has chatrooms, but not:

A City Home screen: featured events, active travelers, quick meetups, top locals, “what’s happening this week”

City-level filters + map/list toggles (even a basic version)

6) Business model realities (not just “create deals”)

If businesses are a real user type, the prompt is missing the core “business workflow”:

Business verification basics (at least lightweight)

Deal lifecycle: draft → live → expired → analytics

Any mention of subscription/paywall or how businesses are gated to features (even if payment is later)

7) Trust & safety that Apple expects (and you’ll want)

You have “references/vouches,” but you’re missing the safety fundamentals:

Block / report user

Report event / report chatroom message

Basic moderation handling (hide blocked users everywhere; prevent messaging)

Safety copy + in-app links to Terms/Privacy + account deletion request

Missing technical specs that will break the build if not stated
A) Session-cookie auth on React Native is non-trivial

You’re using connect.sid cookies. On mobile you must explicitly specify:

How cookies are stored/sent (credentials: "include" alone often isn’t enough in RN)

Whether you’re using a cookie manager (common) or switching to token auth for mobile

CORS / same-site cookie settings needed for mobile networking

B) WebSocket auth + reconnection rules

You list a message format, but you need:

How the socket authenticates (cookie? userId header? auth message on connect?)

Reconnect/backoff rules, offline queueing, and how read receipts are persisted

C) Media upload flow (profile photos, event photos)

You reference profile photos, but the prompt doesn’t define:

Upload endpoint + expected multipart format

Image picker permissions + compression rules

CDN/storage expectations (or at least “use existing backend upload route”)

D) Push notifications

You list it in Phase 4, but your prompt should include:

Device token registration endpoint (or “add /api/push/register”)

Which events trigger pushes (messages, connection request, RSVP updates, flash deal near you)

Copy/paste add-on you can append to the Replit prompt

Add this section verbatim:

MISSING CORE SCREENS / FLOWS TO INCLUDE

Onboarding Wizard (post-signup): interests → hometown → destination+dates → demographics/preferences → profile photo/bio. Discovery is locked until minimum profile completion.

Super Calendar: unified calendar view combining trip dates, RSVP’d events, quick meetups, and reminders. Apple Calendar add/export supported.

City Home: city landing screen (for hometown + destination) showing featured events, active travelers, locals, quick meetups, and weekly highlights.

Third-party Events: support imported events (Meetup/Eventbrite/etc.) with source label, save/RSVP behavior, and safe external link handling.

Trust & Safety: block/report user, report event/message, hide blocked users globally, plus Terms/Privacy + account deletion access in settings.

Business Workflow: deal lifecycle (draft/live/expired), basic analytics, and business gating/verification placeholders.

MOBILE TECH REQUIREMENTS

Cookie-based session auth must work in React Native (explicit cookie handling strategy required).

WebSocket auth/reconnect rules must be implemented and aligned with backend expectations.

Implement profile/event image upload flow using existing backend routes (multipart upload + image compression).

Push notification architecture included (device token registration + triggers).

If you tell me the top nav / core pages of your current web app (just a quick list), I’ll map every one to the mobile tab structure and call out anything else you’re missing in this prom
