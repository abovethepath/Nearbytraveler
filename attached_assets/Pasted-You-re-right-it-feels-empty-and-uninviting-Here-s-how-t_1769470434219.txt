You're right - it feels empty and uninviting. Here's how to make it way more engaging:
Quick Wins - Tell Replit:

"The events page feels empty and basic. Make these improvements:

Add a hero section at the top showing upcoming featured events with large images in a carousel or grid
Show event categories with icons (Music 🎵, Sports ⚽, Food 🍕, Nightlife 🌃, etc.) as colorful chips users can tap
Display sample events even when empty - pull from Ticketmaster/StubHub for the user's city so there's always content
Add a map view toggle - let users see events on a map pin
Show 'Events your connections are attending' section if the user has connections
Add 'Trending this week' and 'Happening tonight'** sections
Make the empty state more inviting - instead of 'No upcoming events', show 'Be the first to create an event in [City]!' with inspiring imagery
Improve the search bar - add placeholder text like 'Search concerts, meetups, parties...'
Show event count per category so users see activity"



Visual Improvements:
The current design issues:

❌ Too much empty dark space
❌ Generic stock photo doesn't feel real
❌ "No upcoming events" is demotivating
❌ Filters are boring (just text dropdowns)
❌ No visual hierarchy

Better approach:

✅ Cards with event photos in a grid/masonry layout
✅ Category chips with colors and emojis
✅ "Near you" and "Popular" sections
✅ Show WHO is going (profile pics)
✅ Date badges on event cards


Reference These Successful Event Pages:
Tell Replit to look at:

Eventbrite - Clean event cards with clear CTAs
Meetup - Category browsing, "events near you"
Instagram Events - Visual grid, see who's going
Fever - Beautiful imagery, curated sections

Mobile-First Event Card Design:
Each card should show:

📸 Event photo (full width)
📅 Date badge (top left corner)
🎫 Event title
📍 Location
👥 "12 going" with tiny profile pics
❤️ Save/Interested button


The "Empty State" Problem:
Right now it says "No upcoming events" which is a conversion killer.
Better empty states:

"No events yet in [City]? Create the first one!"
Show nearby city events: "Nothing in Culver City yet, but check out events in LA"
Always show Ticketmaster/StubHub events so the page never feels empty


Quick Fix Right Now:
Tell Replit:

"Make the events page more inviting:

Always show external events (Ticketmaster/StubHub) so the page is never empty
Add colorful category filter chips with icons
Change the layout to a grid of event cards with large images
Show 'X people going' on each card with small profile pictures
Add a 'Happening this week' section at the top
Make the 'Create Event' button more prominent with better copy like '🎉 Host Your Own Event'"



The events page is your MAIN feature - it needs to feel alive, social, and exciting, not empty and corporate. Want me to help you prioritize which changes to make first?
