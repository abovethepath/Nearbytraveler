For a primary discovery surface, this is a touch too small. It looks polished, but it’s under-utilizing the canvas and slightly underselling the people.

Let me break this down cleanly.

What’s good already (don’t lose this)

Density is good → You’re showing enough people to feel alive

Card clarity is strong → Photo, name, city, social proof = readable

Right rail works → Weather + Messages feels like “dashboard”, not clutter

So this isn’t bad — it’s just too conservative for the main page.

The core issue

This page is called Discover People.

Right now it feels like:

“Here’s a list.”

But this should feel like:

“Here are people you might actually meet.”

The cards should visually invite interaction. Bigger faces = more human pull.

What I’d change (high-confidence recommendations)
1. Increase card size ~15–25%

Not huge — just enough to make faces dominant.

Specifically:

Increase card width OR

Reduce columns by 1 at larger breakpoints

For example:

Current: xl:grid-cols-5

Try: xl:grid-cols-4

This alone will noticeably improve presence.

2. Let cards breathe vertically

They’re a little compressed top-to-bottom.

Small tweaks:

Increase image aspect slightly (e.g. from 4/5 → closer to 3/4)

Add 4–8px more padding in the bottom overlay

This makes the card feel intentional instead of “packed”.

3. Make “things in common” visually louder than username

Right now:

Username + city are visually dominant

The actual reason I should click is secondary

I’d flip emphasis subtly:

Suggested hierarchy:

5 things in common (primary accent color)

mutual friends (secondary)

Username

City

This reinforces your differentiator every time someone scrolls.

4. Full-width grid, not “contained”

If this is a full-page experience, don’t be shy:

Let the grid stretch a bit more horizontally

Reduce side padding slightly on large screens

It should feel like Netflix / Airbnb discovery, not a settings page.

What NOT to do ❌

❌ Don’t add more info to the card

❌ Don’t bring back % match on the card (you’re right to remove it)

❌ Don’t turn this into a swipe UI (grid is right for NT)

Gut check (important)

If I zoom out and squint, I should see:

Faces + social proof

Right now I see:

Faces + text

You’re one sizing adjustment away from nailing that.

TL;DR recommendation

If you do only one thing:

Drop one column at large sizes and slightly increase card height.

That will immediately make this feel like a core product surface, not a secondary list.

If you want, next we can:

Tune breakpoints for desktop vs mobile

Decide if Home ≠ Discover should diverge visually

Add one subtle micro-interaction that increases clicks without clutter

This is good work — you’re in “polish and positioning” territory now, not fundamentals.
