And you’re also right about one thing: Replit can generate the scaffolding in ~10 minutes.
What won’t be “10 minutes” is getting it to be reliable on real users (no broken JSON, no wrong mappings, no weird edge cases, good mobile keyboard behavior, safe edits, etc.). That’s where time goes.

So here’s my honest take on Replit’s plan

Replit’s proposed approach is correct. The architecture is the standard pattern:

Chat → LLM → JSON → Review screen → Save.

If Replit builds it fast, great — but you want to make sure it includes these 6 non-negotiables, otherwise you’ll ship something flaky.

⸻

The 6 things you MUST require (or it’ll be janky)
	1.	Strict JSON-only output

	•	If the model returns extra text, your parser breaks.
	•	Must enforce: “Return JSON only. No markdown. No commentary.”

	2.	Schema validation before save

	•	Validate required fields + types.
	•	If invalid → ask one follow-up question or show “Fix these fields.”

	3.	Review screen (editable)

	•	Never auto-save AI output.
	•	Users must be able to edit interests/tags easily.

	4.	Mapping to your predefined options

	•	You said you have 74 interests etc.
	•	Must do fuzzy match + confidence threshold:
	•	if confidence low → ask user to pick from list.

	5.	Audit trail

	•	Save the raw chat transcript (or at least the final answers) so you can debug.
	•	Add a “Regenerate” button.

	6.	Mobile UX

	•	Chat input + keyboard behavior in iOS wrapper is where things break.
	•	You need proper scrolling, focus handling, and “Send” button behavior.

About “3–5 days” vs “10 minutes”

Here’s the reality:
	•	10 minutes: Replit generates a working demo that looks right.
	•	Real-world ready: you’ll spend time on:
	•	mapping accuracy (hiking vs “Hiking & Trails”)
	•	location parsing
	•	validation + error handling
	•	preventing garbage bios
	•	edge cases (“I’m from LA but live in NYC now”)
	•	rate limits / costs / retries

So the right expectation to hold:

“Replit will build v1 instantly; I’ll still need to harden it.”

That’s not you being negative — that’s you being a product owner.

What I’d tell Replit to do (so it doesn’t cut corners)

Paste this into Replit as the build spec:

Build AI-assisted onboarding as an optional path: chat UI asks 6–8 questions, then call LLM to return STRICT JSON matching our profile schema. Validate the JSON with Zod before saving. If parsing/validation fails, show an error and ask a follow-up question. Add a Review/Edit screen before save. Map interests/activities to our predefined option lists via fuzzy matching + user confirmation when confidence is low. Save the transcript + final JSON for debugging. Ensure mobile keyboard + scroll behavior works in iOS WebView.

If you send me:
	•	a screenshot of what Replit actually built (UI + code snippets), or
	•	the generated prompt + JSON schema it used,

I’ll tell you exactly what’s missing / risky and how to tighten it so it doesn’t break the first time a real user says something weird.
