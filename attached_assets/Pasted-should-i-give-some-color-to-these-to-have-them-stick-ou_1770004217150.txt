should i give some color to these to have them stick out, some of these arent see n unless clicked on

Yeah — but you don’t need to “paint” every tab. The real issue in your screenshot is low contrast + weak state differences, so inactive tabs blend into the bar and only feel “real” once clicked.

Here are 3 good approaches (pick one). They all keep it clean and make tabs readable before interaction.

Option 1: Subtle but clear (my default recommendation)

Make inactive tabs slightly brighter + add a stronger hover, and make the active tab look like a “pill button”.

Inactive tabs

slightly lighter background than the bar

readable text

border visible

Active tab

solid/gradient background

darker text (or white) + shadow

stronger border

Badges

always visible (high contrast)

active badge matches tab

This gives you clarity without looking childish.

Option 2: Color only for badges (cleanest)

If you’re worried about it looking too colorful: keep the tab pills mostly neutral, but make the count badge pop.

Example:

Tab: neutral pill

Badge: colored (blue/purple) with strong contrast

This instantly solves “not seen unless clicked” because your eye catches the badge + label.

Option 3: Category colors (only if you want “fun”)

Assign each tab a faint tint (5–10% opacity) by category:

Contacts = blue tint

Photos = green tint

Travel = purple tint

Countries = orange tint

Keep it subtle so it doesn’t look like a rainbow toolbar.

Quick Tailwind drop-in (works well with your dark gradient header)
Tab base
const base =
  "px-4 py-2 rounded-lg text-sm font-semibold transition-all border " +
  "focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white/40";

Inactive
const inactive =
  "bg-white/5 text-white/80 border-white/10 hover:bg-white/10 hover:text-white";

Active
const active =
  "bg-white/15 text-white border-white/25 shadow-sm";

Badge (always visible)
const badge =
  "ml-2 inline-flex items-center justify-center min-w-5 h-5 px-1.5 " +
  "rounded-full text-xs font-bold bg-white/15 text-white border border-white/15";


Then:

<button className={`${base} ${isActive ? active : inactive}`}>
  Contacts <span className={badge}>1</span>
</button>


If you want the active tab to “pop” more, replace bg-white/15 with your brand gradient for the active tab only.

Tiny UX upgrades that help a lot

Add an underline indicator under the active tab (even subtle).

Increase inactive text from white/70 → white/80-90.

Make the tab bar background a touch darker so pills contrast more.

Add icons only if tabs are still hard to scan (👤 📷 ✈️ 🌍).

If you paste the component (or tell me if you’re using shadcn Tabs or your own buttons), I’ll give you the exact classnames matching your current style so it’s a copy/paste fix.
