This is launch-ready. The last “must-have” I’d add (if you do only one more thing) is ranking + filters on the match results, powered by City Picks.

Next best feature: Better matches list (small build, big perceived value)
1) Sort matches by “best fit”

On the city matches results page, rank users by:

# shared City Picks (highest)

then # shared Universal Preferences

then proximity / last active (if you have it)

2) Add quick filters (mobile friendly)

At the top of the results list:

Has ≥2 shared picks (toggle)

Same Trip Group (toggle)

Same dates overlap (toggle, if you have dates)

Only people going to my event(s) (if events exist)

3) Make the “why” obvious

On each user card, show:

“3 shared picks • 2 shared preferences”
and your “You both selected…” chips underneath (you already have this).

Second-best quick win: analytics for your launch

Track these events so you can iterate fast in LA:

City Picks opened

picks selected

added custom pick

used Reset to Popular

clicked Suggest 6 more

clicked a match card

sent first message / RSVP’d to an event

Even basic logging to DB helps.

If you want me to pick one: Match ranking + filters. That’s the fastest way to make users feel “wow, it actually found my people.”

is this getting to be too much

No — what you’ve built is the right amount for launch as long as you stop adding new surface area.

You’re at a good “feature-complete” point:

City Picks is clear

Users can add/delete

Popular is curated

AI is controlled

Mutual picks shows value

If you keep stacking more filters/ranking/analytics right now, it can start to feel heavy and distract from the core loop.

What I’d do for LA launch

Freeze features. Only do:

Bug fixes

Performance + mobile polish

Small copy tweaks

One metric to watch: % of users who select 3–8 picks and then message/meet

If you must add one more thing

Do sorting by shared picks (silent improvement, no extra UI).
Skip adding new filters until you see real user behavior.

So: not too much — but you’re at the point where “more” is less valuable than polish + stability + usage.
