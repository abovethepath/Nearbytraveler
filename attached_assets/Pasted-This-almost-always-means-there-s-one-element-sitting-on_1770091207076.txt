This almost always means there’s one element sitting on top of the CTA row (often a gradient/blur overlay, a “shine” layer, or a full-size link/div used to make the hero clickable). Your z-index changes on the buttons won’t help if:


the blocker is in a different stacking context (created by transform, filter, opacity, isolation, etc.), or


the blocker is later in the DOM and already above, or


the blocker is a full-cover element (absolute inset-0) with normal pointer-events.


Here’s how to identify the exact blocker and the two fixes that solve 99% of cases.

1) Find the invisible blocker in 10 seconds (DevTools)
In Chrome DevTools Console, run this while the page is showing the buttons:
const btn = document.querySelector('[data-testid="button-message"]');
const r = btn.getBoundingClientRect();
document.elementFromPoint(r.left + 10, r.top + 10);

Whatever that returns is what’s eating the click.
If it’s something like a hero overlay <div>, a ::before pseudo layer, an absolute inset-0 element, or a stretched <a>, that’s your culprit.
Also check if any parent has transform / filter / opacity < 1 in the Computed panel — those create stacking contexts that make z-index “feel broken”.

2) The real fix: make decorative hero layers ignore clicks
If your hero has overlay div(s)
Find things like:


absolute inset-0


bg-gradient-to-*


backdrop-blur


opacity-*


z-*


…and add pointer-events-none to them.
Example pattern (recommended structure):
<div className="relative isolate overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
  {/* Decorative layers MUST ignore pointer events */}
  <div
    aria-hidden="true"
    className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500/30 to-purple-500/30"
  />
  <div
    aria-hidden="true"
    className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 backdrop-blur-[2px]"
  />

  {/* Real content */}
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* ...profile content... */}

    {!isOwnProfile && (
      <div className="relative z-20 pointer-events-auto flex items-center gap-3 flex-wrap min-w-0">
        {/* your buttons */}
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
</div>

Why isolate? It prevents weird interactions with outside stacking contexts and makes your z-* layering more predictable.

3) Common “gotcha”: a full-cover Link/div is on top
Sometimes people do this to make the whole hero clickable:
<Link className="absolute inset-0" to="..." />

That will block EVERYTHING underneath.
Fix it like this:
<Link className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none" to="..." />

Then, if you still want some areas clickable, only wrap the specific area in a link—not the whole hero.

4) If your overlay is a pseudo-element (before: / after:)
If the hero background is built like:
<div className="relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:bg-gradient-to-r ...">

Then add:
<div className="relative isolate
  before:absolute before:inset-0 before:pointer-events-none before:z-0
">
  <div className="relative z-10">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

before:pointer-events-none is the key.

5) What I would do in your case (fastest, safest change)
Leave your CTA code mostly as-is and fix the hero layers:


Find the hero gradient/blur overlay div(s) near where the CTAs render


Add pointer-events-none to those overlay layers


Add isolate to the hero wrapper


Ensure the “content container” is relative z-10 and CTAs relative z-20


Your CTA wrapper is already good:
<div className="flex items-center gap-3 flex-wrap min-w-0 relative z-20">

So the blocker is almost certainly outside this CTA block.

If you paste the hero wrapper markup above this CTA block (the part that includes the gradient/overlay/background layers), I can point to the exact element/class that’s blocking and tell you the minimal one-line change.
