NearbyTraveler Community Manifesto

Where Locals and Travelers Belong Together

1. We Believe in Human Connection

The real treasures of travel aren’t monuments or tourist traps — they’re the people you meet along the way. We exist to make sure no trip feels lonely, and no amazing connection is ever lost.

2. We’re One Global Tribe

Whether you’re a traveler in a new city or a local welcoming people in, you’re part of the same community. We’re united by curiosity, kindness, and a shared love for experiences that bring us together.

3. We Show Up

This community thrives because people say yes:

Yes to grabbing dinner with someone new.

Yes to joining a hike, a party, a concert, or a coffee.

Yes to making time, even if it means driving across town.
We show up — for each other, and for the experience.

4. We Host and We Share

Homes, stories, tables, playlists, laughter. Locals create spaces that travelers can step into, and travelers bring new energy that makes locals see their city with fresh eyes. Everyone has something to give.

5. We Build Trust

Safety and respect come first. Profiles, references, and mutual connections help us know who we’re meeting. But beyond the tools, we trust because we choose to live by our values: kindness, respect, and inclusivity.

6. We Grow Stronger Together

Every new friendship, every event, every shared memory makes this network richer. What starts as a taco crawl in LA or a hike in Barcelona may turn into lifelong friends, global reunions, or even family.

7. We Celebrate Serendipity

The magic is in the unexpected. Meeting someone at a bonfire, then bumping into them years later in another city — these aren’t accidents. They’re what happens when a community is alive, global, and permanent.

8. We’re the Future of Travel

Tourism apps sell tickets. Dating apps sell swipes. NearbyTraveler is different. We’re building the world’s first true social layer of travel — where locals and travelers create friendships that last forever.

✨ The NearbyTraveler Promise

When you join this community, you’re not signing up for an app.
You’re joining a global family — open, adventurous, and always nearby.

👉 This can live as a page on your site/app, be summarized as a pledge new members check off, and become the ethos ambassadors reinforce at events.
