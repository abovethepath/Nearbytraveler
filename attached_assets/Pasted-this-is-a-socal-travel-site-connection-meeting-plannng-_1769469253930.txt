Exactly! So let's make sure those core features are prioritized and optimized. Here's what matters most for your users:

Priority 1: Events (Meeting & Going)
✅ Already optimized:

Event listings fast (40ms)
Event cache working (5min)
RSVP system now has "Going" vs "Interested" ✅
Make sure:

Event discovery is prominent on homepage
Users can easily filter by city/date
RSVP status is clear and visible
Attendee lists show who's going
Priority 2: Connections (Meeting People)
✅ Already optimized:

Matching algorithm cached (54x faster - 83ms)
Connection requests working
Profile bundle fast (149ms)
Check:

Can users easily browse travelers in their city?
Is the "connection request" flow smooth?
Do users see mutual connections/friends?
Can they message after connecting?
Priority 3: Planning (Travel Plans & Itineraries)
✅ Already built:

Travel plans system exists
Itineraries supported
Make sure:

Users can see who's traveling to their city
Travelers can see locals in their destination
Travel dates are prominently displayed
Easy to find overlap ("You'll both be in Paris July 10-15")
Priority 4: References (Trust & Safety)
✅ Already built:

References system exists
Vouches working
Make sure:

References are visible on profiles
Easy to leave a reference after meeting
Badge/count shows number of references
New users understand why references matter
Priority 5: Search (Finding People)
✅ Partially optimized:

Database indexes help
Check if users can search by:

City/location
Travel dates
User type (traveler/local/business)
Interests/hobbies
Tell Replit to Prioritize These Features:
If anything feels clunky in these core flows, tell Replit:

"The core user journey is: discover events → meet people → make connections → plan meetups → leave references. Walk through this flow and identify any friction points in the UX. Make sure event discovery, connection requests, and messaging are prominent and easy to use."
