Looking at this Input component, the issue is likely a specificity problem with the dark mode styles. The current implementation has the right styles, but they may not be applying correctly in all cases.
Here's the fixed version with better organized dark mode styling:
tsximport * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const Input = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, React.ComponentProps<"input">>(
  ({ className, type, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <input
        type={type}
        className={cn(
          // Layout
          "flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border px-3 py-2 text-base md:text-sm",
          // Light mode colors
          "bg-white border-gray-300 text-gray-900",
          // Dark mode colors (ensures text is visible)
          "dark:bg-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 dark:text-white",
          // Focus states - light mode
          "focus:bg-white focus:text-gray-900",
          // Focus states - dark mode (prevents white on white)
          "dark:focus:bg-gray-700 dark:focus:text-white",
          // Placeholder
          "placeholder:text-gray-500 dark:placeholder:text-gray-400",
          // Focus ring
          "focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2",
          // Disabled state
          "disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50",
          // File input
          "file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium file:text-foreground",
          // Calendar picker dark mode fix
          "dark:[&::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator]:filter dark:[&::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator]:invert dark:[&::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator]:brightness-100 dark:[&::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator]:!opacity-100",
          "ring-offset-background",
          className
        )}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)

Input.displayName = "Input"

export { Input }
Key changes:

Reorganized classes for better readability and to ensure dark mode variants are properly applied
Grouped light and dark mode styles together so they don't conflict
Explicit focus states for both light and dark modes to prevent the white-on-white issue

The reorganization ensures that:

dark:bg-gray-700 properly overrides bg-white in dark mode
dark:text-white ensures text is always visible against the dark background
Focus states maintain the same colors to prevent flickering or visibility issues

This fix should work for all the chat input fields you mentioned without needing changes to those individual files, since they're all using this shared Input component.
