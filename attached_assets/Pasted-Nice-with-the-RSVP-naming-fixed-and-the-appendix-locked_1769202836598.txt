Nice — with the RSVP naming fixed and the appendix locked to real payloads, that prompt is in the “no guessing” zone.

Here’s what to do next so Replit actually turns that 1100-line spec into a working Expo app (and not just a pretty folder tree).

Start the Replit mobile project (fast path)

Create → Mobile App (Expo/React Native) in Replit (new project).

Add your mobile-app-prompt.md to the repo root.

In the Replit AI / Agent, give a short command like:

“Read mobile-app-prompt.md. Implement P0 screens and navigation first, using the API appendix exactly. Do not invent endpoints or fields.”

The 5 “make-or-break” implementation checks

These are the spots where scaffolds usually compile but don’t work:

Cookie session auth on native

Confirm the mobile app actually persists connect.sid after login and sends it on subsequent calls.

If cookies don’t stick, you’ll see /api/auth/user fail even though login returns 200.

WebSocket auth

If your WS relies on cookies, verify the socket handshake includes them (often differs from browser).

If not, fall back to whatever your backend already supports (your prompt mentions x-user-id as a fallback for some endpoints—just be consistent and don’t mix randomly).

Null safety everywhere

You already called this out — make sure the generated UI really handles: profileImage: null, destinationCity: null, reactions: null, repliedMessage: null.

Timezone display

Backend dates end in Z (UTC). Make sure the UI shows local time (especially Events + Trips), not raw UTC.

Tabs match your “FINAL” structure

Regular: Home / Events / Chatrooms / Messages / Profile (+ FAB)

Business: Dashboard / Deals / Messages / Search / Profile (+ FAB)

A clean “Phase 1 smoke test” (takes 5 minutes)

After Replit generates the app, run these in order:

Login → immediately call GET /api/auth/user and render name + userType.

Home → GET /api/users list renders (with business cards not crashing).

Messages tab → GET /api/conversations/:userId list renders.

Open a DM → GET /api/messages/:userId renders bubbles + reply preview + reactions.

Create Trip → verify Chatrooms tab refreshes and destination appears via GET /api/chatrooms/my-locations.

iOS permissions you’ll want in app.json early

Even if you build later, add now so you don’t get blocked:

Photo library (profile image)

Camera (optional capture)

Notifications (push later)

Location (if “Near Me” / meetups need it)

If you paste the first Replit build output (or the first blocking error, like auth/cookies), I’ll tell you exactly which part of the spec needs a tweak vs which part is just implementation.
