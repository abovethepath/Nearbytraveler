
can you give me a list to give to replit a summary of every thing we changed today on the webside 

Summary of changes for Replit:
Website / Client Changes
1. Chatroom modal (client/src/pages/profile-complete.tsx + client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx)
Raised z-index to 2147483647 so the modal stays on top in WebView
Added pointerEvents: 'auto', touchAction: 'pan-y', overscrollBehavior: 'contain' so the modal scrolls correctly
Wrapped the chatroom list in a scrollable container with overflow-y-auto and WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'
2. Cities page (client/src/pages/discover.tsx)
Switched cities grid from 1 to 2 columns on mobile
Reduced card height on mobile: h-36 (was h-48)
Reduced padding and text size on mobile: p-3 sm:p-5, text-base sm:text-xl, text-xs sm:text-base
3. Match-in-city (City Plans) page (client/src/pages/match-in-city.tsx)
Removed tally/count displays (section counts and “People Who Match” count)
Fixed “More city Ideas” pills: added activityName fallback for selection and e.preventDefault() / e.stopPropagation() on click
Fixed Universal Match Preferences: removed scroll-mt-24 to stop jump on pill click
Increased “Suggested for you” suggestions from 5 to 10
Increased shared activities preview per user from 2 to 5
Added activityName fallback for isSelected on AI activity pills
Removed debug console.logs
Server Changes
4. Matching users API (server/routes.ts)
Matching now includes users who share city picks (not only profile interests)
Increased matching users limit from 20 to 50
Adjusted compatibleUsers logic to prioritize users with shared city picks
Expo App Changes (not on Replit)
Removed expo-speech-recognition (package + plugin) to fix native module crash
Updated header: logo size, avatar visibility, centering
WebViewScreens.js: simplified getSpeechModule() to always return null
