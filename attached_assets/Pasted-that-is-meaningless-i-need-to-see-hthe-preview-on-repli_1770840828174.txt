that is meaningless i need to see hthe preview on replit

Got it. If you must see it in Replit’s preview, then we need to force Replit to attach its webview to your running port in this workspace. Since Ports panel is missing, the most reliable way is to make Replit treat the repl as a “web repl” by using the built-in web module + a plain run command, and remove workflows from the equation.

Do these steps exactly (they’re reversible):

1) Edit .replit to the simplest possible web config

Replace your .replit content with this minimal version:

modules = ["nodejs-20", "web"]

run = "npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0"

[env]
PORT = "5000"


Important: Remove [[workflows]] blocks entirely for now. Workflows are what’s breaking the attachment.

(You can paste your old workflows back later once preview works.)

2) Restart Replit completely

This matters because the webview attachment happens at session start.

Click Stop

Refresh the entire browser tab (reload Replit page)

Click Run once

3) Confirm the server is still listening on 0.0.0.0:5000

In Shell:

cat /proc/net/tcp | awk 'NR==1 || $2 ~ /:1388/ {print}'


You should see 00000000:1388.

4) Open Preview from the “web” module

After doing the minimal .replit, Replit should show a webview/preview panel automatically when you hit Run. If it doesn’t, look for:

a small browser icon near the top-right

or a tab that says Webview / Output

(Workspaces often hide “Ports”, but the web module forces the webview UI to appear.)

Why this works

Right now your .replit is telling Replit to run a workflow system, but your workspace proxy isn’t attaching to it. The web module + direct run = ... path is the old reliable mechanism that triggers Replit’s preview system.

If you do this and it STILL refuses

Then this workspace literally does not support live webview preview routing (org/workspace setting). In that case there is no code change that will make preview work — it’s disabled upstream.

But do the minimal .replit first. It fixes this in the majority of “preview refuses to connect” cases.

If you paste your updated .replit after you change it (just the file), I’ll sanity-check it line-by-line.
