## From the Founder

*"After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned that one connection can change everything. Travelers spend billions on flights and hotels, yet the most valuable part — the people you meet — is left to chance. I built the solution I wished existed."*

**— Aaron Lefkowitz, Founder**
