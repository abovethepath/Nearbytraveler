from that screenshot you’re basically getting one giant tile per row, which defeats the point. That usually happens for one of two reasons:

The parent layout is still flex flex-col (or a list), so everything stacks.

The card wrapper is forcing full width (w-full, max-w-*, col-span-full, or min-w-[…]), so the grid can’t form 2 columns.

Here’s exactly what to tell Replit to do.

What to tell Replit (copy/paste)

Goal: Make “Discover People” a 2-column grid on mobile, not a single-column list.

1) Fix the parent container (this is the main issue)

Replace the list wrapper with a grid:

Mobile: grid-cols-2

Tablet: md:grid-cols-3

Desktop: lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5

Gap tight: gap-2

2) Remove full-width / max-width constraints that force 1 column

Search the card + wrapper for any of these and remove/override them:

max-w-sm, max-w-md, max-w-lg, w-full on an outer wrapper

col-span-2, col-span-full, flex-col list wrappers

min-w-[320px] or similar

In tile view, each card should be: w-full min-w-0 max-w-none

3) Force a compact tile height (no “content grows taller”)

Use a fixed aspect ratio for the image tile:

aspect-[3/4] or aspect-[4/5]

Image: object-cover

4) Keep text minimal

Only show:

name (1 line)

city (1 line)

optional “X shared picks • Y prefs” (1 line)

No bio paragraphs. No big tag stacks. Max 0–2 chips.

Minimal Tailwind example (what Replit should implement)
// DiscoverPeople.tsx (or wherever the list is rendered)
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-2">
  {users.map((u) => (
    <button
      key={u.id}
      className="w-full min-w-0 max-w-none rounded-2xl overflow-hidden bg-white/5 border border-white/10"
    >
      <div className="relative aspect-[4/5]">
        <img
          src={u.photoUrl}
          className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
          alt=""
        />
        <div className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 p-2 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/70 to-transparent">
          <div className="text-sm font-semibold truncate">{u.username}</div>
          <div className="text-xs opacity-80 truncate">{u.city}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </button>
  ))}
</div>

Quick diagnostic (why yours is still 1 column)

If Replit “made a grid” but you still see 1 column, it’s almost always because each tile is inside something like:

<div className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto"> ...tile... </div> ✅ (this forces a single column)
or the wrapper is still flex flex-col.

Tell Replit: remove the max-width wrapper around each card and apply grid at the list level only.

If you paste the component names (the file that renders “Discover People” + the card component), I’ll tell you exactly where to remove the max-w-* / w-full that’s blocking the 2-column grid.
