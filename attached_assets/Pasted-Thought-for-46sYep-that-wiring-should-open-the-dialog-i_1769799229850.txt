Thought for 46sYep — that wiring should open the dialog if isEditMode actually stays true through the render that includes the <Dialog />.
Here are the most common reasons this exact pattern “logs true but no modal” happens, and how to prove/fix each one.

1) The component is re-mounting (state resets back to false)
This is #1 when you see:


✅ button log fires


✅ DIALOG RENDER CHECK - isEditMode: true appears once


then it goes back to false (or the dialog never appears)


Cause: the component that owns const [isEditMode…] is getting re-mounted (e.g., parent key changes, conditional rendering flips, responsive layout swaps components, etc.). When it remounts, state resets to initial false.
How to confirm (fast):
Add this right next to the state:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("🧩 Profile component mounted");
  return () => console.log("🧩 Profile component unmounted");
}, []);

If you see an unmount right after clicking the button → that’s your bug.
Where to look:


Any key={...} on the component tree above this


Any conditional like {isMobile ? <A/> : <B/>} where A/B both contain their own state


Anything that depends on user/profile loading that re-renders into a different branch


Fix: move the isEditMode state up to a parent that isn’t swapping/unmounting, or remove the remount trigger.

2) It opens and immediately closes (outside click / pointerdown issue)
This one is sneaky: you click the button, set true, Radix opens, then it detects the same pointer event as an “outside interaction” and closes → onOpenChange(false) fires right away.
Your logs will show:


button clicked


render check shows true


then Dialog onOpenChange called with: false


If you see that, don’t fight it—use the Radix/shadcn way:
✅ Fix: use DialogTrigger instead of manual onClick
Put the buttons inside the <Dialog> and let them be triggers:
<Dialog open={isEditMode} onOpenChange={setIsEditMode}>
  <DialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button
      size="sm"
      variant="outline"
      className={`sm:hidden ${isProfileIncomplete() ? 'bg-red-100 hover:bg-red-200 border-red-400 text-red-700 animate-pulse' : 'bg-blue-50 hover:bg-blue-100 border-blue-200 text-blue-700 dark:bg-blue-900 dark:hover:bg-blue-800 dark:border-blue-700 dark:text-blue-100'}`}
      aria-label="Edit Profile"
    >
      <Edit2 className="w-4 h-4" />
    </Button>
  </DialogTrigger>

  <DialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button
      size="sm"
      variant="outline"
      className={`hidden sm:inline-flex ${isProfileIncomplete() ? 'bg-red-100 hover:bg-red-200 border-red-400 text-red-700 animate-pulse' : 'bg-blue-50 hover:bg-blue-100 border-blue-200 text-blue-700 dark:bg-blue-900 dark:hover:bg-blue-800 dark:border-blue-700 dark:text-blue-100'}`}
    >
      <Edit2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
      Edit Profile
    </Button>
  </DialogTrigger>

  <DialogContent className="max-w-[95vw] w-full md:max-w-2xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>Edit Profile</DialogTitle>
    </DialogHeader>
    ...
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>

This eliminates the “open then instantly close” class of problems.

3) The dialog is opening, but it’s behind something (z-index / overlay)
If your logs show isEditMode: true and it stays true, but you don’t see the modal:
Check DOM:
Open DevTools → Elements → search for data-state="open" or DialogContent.
If it’s in the DOM, it’s a CSS stacking issue.
Fix (quick test):
Temporarily add a high z-index:
<DialogContent className="z-[9999] ...">

Also check if you have any parent containers doing:


transform


filter


perspective


or weird z-index stacking contexts


Radix portals usually dodge this, but if your DialogContent is not portaling (custom Dialog component), stacking contexts can bite.

4) You’re importing the wrong Dialog component (or a mismatched one)
If you accidentally have multiple Dialog implementations (Radix vs something else), open may not do what you think.
Confirm import:
Make sure it’s from your shadcn path, like:
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

If it’s from somewhere else, controlled mode may differ.

5) Something else is forcing setIsEditMode(false)
Search the file for:


setIsEditMode(false)


setIsEditMode(


A common pattern is an effect like “when profile loads, exit edit mode”.

What I’d do in your shoes (fastest path)


Click button and watch for onOpenChange(false) immediately.


If yes → switch to DialogTrigger (fix #2).


If no, but it still doesn’t show → check mount/unmount logs (fix #1) and inspect DOM/z-index (fix #3).


If you paste the 10–20 lines of console output from one click (button log + render check + onOpenChange), I can tell you which of the 5 it is in one shot.
