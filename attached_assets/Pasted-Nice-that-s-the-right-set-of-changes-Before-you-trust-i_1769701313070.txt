Nice — that’s the right set of changes. Before you trust it, do these quick sanity checks (this is where stuff usually breaks):

1) DB / migrations: make sure there isn’t a duplicate “travelGroup” column

If the column truly already existed, confirm Replit didn’t accidentally add a second one (or add it with a different casing/name like travel_group vs travelGroup).

Verify in DB schema: only one travelGroup field on travel_plans.

2) Create Trip: confirm it actually saves to the trip row

Create a trip with a non-default group (e.g., profile = Solo, trip = Family), then check:

API request payload includes travelGroup

travel_plans.travelGroup is set in the database

3) Edit Trip: confirm it updates and doesn’t get overwritten

Change the trip vibe on an existing trip and ensure it persists.

Also test editing other fields (dates/city) and confirm travelGroup doesn’t get wiped to null.

4) Matching fallback logic: verify priority order in real output

Test 3 scenarios and confirm “What you have in common” shows the right thing:

Trip has travelGroup set → use trip value

Trip travelGroup null → use user profile travelGroup

Both null → handle gracefully (don’t show weird blanks)

5) City Picks rename: confirm links/routes didn’t break

All nav labels say City Picks

Clicking takes you to the right page

Any deep links/bookmarks still work (keep the route slug if you can)

One important “gotcha” to fix if it’s still in the code

If your backend uses { ...req.body } directly, that’s a mass-assignment risk (users can send fields you didn’t intend). Even if it’s an MVP, it’s worth tightening:

✅ Replace spread with a whitelist of allowed fields for travel plans (cityId, startDate, endDate, travelStyle, travelGroup, etc.).

Tiny content check

You replaced “Day Trips” with Guided Tours — good. Make sure AI generation doesn’t re-add generic universals (bars/museums/hiking) as city-specific items.

If you want, paste:

the travel_plans Drizzle schema, and

the matching query where “what you have in common” is computed,
and I’ll point out the exact line(s) to confirm the fallback is correct and safe.
