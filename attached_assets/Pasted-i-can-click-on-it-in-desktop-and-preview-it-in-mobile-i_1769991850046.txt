i can click on it in desktop, and preview it in mobile immediately and the edit is ooened in mobile, so the button sort of is working but not viewable
Thought for 44s

Got it — that actually narrows it down a lot:

✅ Your click/state is working (because when you preview mobile it’s already open).
❌ On desktop, the “edit modal” is either rendered but hidden, off-screen, behind the overlay, or clipped by a parent.

The #1 reason this happens (especially with Tailwind) is: a responsive hidden / md:hidden / lg:hidden (or similar) is hiding the DialogContent on desktop breakpoints.

Here’s how to confirm + fix fast.

1) Confirm the dialog exists in the DOM on desktop

Open the dialog (click Edit), then run this in DevTools console:

(() => {
  const el =
    document.querySelector('[role="dialog"]') ||
    document.querySelector('[data-radix-dialog-content]') ||
    document.querySelector('[data-state="open"]');

  if (!el) return console.log("No dialog element found in DOM");

  const r = el.getBoundingClientRect();
  const cs = getComputedStyle(el);

  console.log("Dialog element:", el);
  console.log("Rect:", r);
  console.log("display/visibility/opacity/zIndex:", cs.display, cs.visibility, cs.opacity, cs.zIndex);
})();

What the results usually mean

display: none → you have hidden / md:hidden somewhere.

visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 → state styles or transitions stuck.

Rect is huge but you can’t see it → it’s likely behind overlay (z-index).

Rect is 0x0 or way off screen → positioning/transform issue.

Rect looks normal but still not visible → it’s being clipped by an overflow-hidden ancestor (if not portaled).

2) Hunt the “hidden on desktop” class (most likely)

With the dialog open, inspect the dialog content element and look at className.

If you see any of these on the dialog content OR a wrapper around it, that’s your bug:

md:hidden

lg:hidden

hidden md:block (this hides by default unless md)

md:opacity-0, md:invisible

md:-z-10, etc.

Why this fits your symptom perfectly:
When you “preview mobile,” your viewport becomes small → Tailwind doesn’t apply md:* → the dialog becomes visible.

✅ Fix: remove the responsive hiding and use responsive sizing instead:

<DialogContent className="w-[95vw] sm:max-w-lg md:max-w-2xl">
  ...
</DialogContent>

3) If it’s there but behind the overlay: fix z-index

Common with custom overlays.

Make sure overlay < content:

<DialogOverlay className="fixed inset-0 z-40 bg-black/50" />
<DialogContent className="fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 z-50 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
  ...
</DialogContent>


(Or just force it temporarily: z-[9999] on content to prove it.)

4) If it’s clipped: you’re not portaling the dialog

If your dialog is rendered inside a parent with overflow-hidden (or a transformed parent) and you’re not portaling to document.body, it can “open” but not be visible.

Fix by ensuring Radix/Shadcn default portal is used:

<Dialog open={isEditMode} onOpenChange={setIsEditMode}>
  <DialogContent>...</DialogContent>
</Dialog>


…and don’t wrap the content in containers that change it to non-portaled rendering.
