🔹 Refinements
1. Open with Heart, Not Just Problem

Instead of jumping into “I can’t always host…,” start with the shared love:

"As a 15-year Couchsurfing host and traveler, I’ve had some of the best moments of my life meeting people through the community. But over time, I realized I couldn’t always host, I couldn’t always find a couch — yet I always wanted to meet travelers. That’s why I created Nearby Traveler."

This feels less like a complaint, more like an evolution.

2. Simplify the Benefits

Your “Beyond Just Needing a Couch” section is great, but it can be tightened into one short list:

Meet through interests and activities, not just accommodation.

Connect at cafés, events, and local spots — no couch required.

Share local secrets and experience cultural exchange.

Connect when you want, how you want — no obligations.

Stay connected across trips.

Feel safe with verification and references.

👉 Shorter, scannable, but keeps all the promises.

3. Talk Directly to Hosts

Your “For Experienced Hosts” section is strong — I’d tighten the language and make it sound more empathetic:

"If you’ve hosted before, you know the magic: meeting fascinating people, sharing your city, learning about new cultures. But hosting can also be exhausting, unpredictable, and sometimes just not possible with work or family life. That doesn’t mean you’re less generous — it just means life changes. With Nearby Traveler, you can keep the spirit of cultural exchange alive in a way that works for you today."

4. Frame “The Couchsurfing Reality” More Simply

Instead of long blocks, turn them into clear contrasts:

Dependent on One Host? → With NT, you meet multiple locals and travelers.

Uncomfortable with couches? → Connect at cafés, events, and public spaces.

Can’t find hosts? → Still find locals and travelers to meet.

5. Closing Call to Action

Make it warm, not salesy:

"Couchsurfing gave us friendships and memories we’ll never forget. Nearby Traveler is the next step — the same spirit, with more flexibility. Whether you’re a longtime host or just someone who loves connecting with people, you belong here."
