Yes: pre-configure it in one place so you don’t have to paste links forever.

Here’s the clean setup I’d do (fast, minimal, works with what you already built):

1) Don’t store “the Luma calendar URL” in random places

Store it once as a City-level default.

Add a city setting (recommended)

If you have a cities table (or city config), add:

defaultExternalCalendarUrl (string)

defaultExternalProvider (“luma” | “partiful” | null)

Set LA to your calendar URL (ex: https://lu.ma/nearbytraveler-la)

Result: Your LA city events page can show:

a “View Official LA Calendar” button

or even embed it later

2) Auto-fill the External RSVP field when creating events (optional but nice)

On “Create Event” (only for LA, only for admins/ambassadors), add a toggle:

✅ “Create matching Luma RSVP link later”
or
✅ “This event is hosted on Luma”

If “hosted on Luma” is enabled:

show the External RSVP field

(optionally) prefill with the calendar URL so they remember the pattern

3) Add simple validation + UX guardrails

When someone pastes the link:

If it’s missing https:// → add it automatically

If it’s not lu.ma (or partiful.com) → show a warning: “External RSVP links should be Luma or Partiful.”

4) Keep Nearby Traveler as the social layer

On the event page buttons order should be:

Join Chat (NT)

RSVP on Luma (external)

That keeps your community in your app, even if RSVP happens outside.

Exactly what I’d tell Cursor/your dev assistant to do next (copy/paste)

Do these two things and stop:

Add a City setting for officialEventsUrl (LA = your Luma calendar URL) and show a button on the LA city events page: “Official LA Events (Luma)”.

In “Create Event”, keep “External RSVP Link” as-is, but add provider detection + auto-add https:// if missing.

That’s it. No over-engineering.

If you want, tell me what your LA Luma calendar slug will be (the lu.ma/_____ part) and I’ll write the exact microcopy for the LA page so it doesn’t feel like you’re sending people away (e.g., “RSVP + guest list hosted on Luma”).

replit is building this end

Good. Let it build — but here’s what you need to make sure it builds correctly.

Because this is where Replit agents can quietly over-engineer things.

You do not want:

• API syncing
• background cron jobs
• webhook listeners
• attendance syncing
• scraping

You only want two simple things.

What Replit Should Actually Build
1️⃣ City-Level Official Calendar URL

Add to your cities table:

officialExternalCalendarUrl: string | null
officialExternalProvider: "luma" | "partiful" | null


Then:

If user is viewing LA → show:

"Official LA Events"
Button → opens your Luma calendar URL.

That’s it.

No data ingestion.

2️⃣ Event-Level External RSVP (already built)

Your existing field:

externalRsvpUrl
externalProvider


Event detail page logic:

If externalRsvpUrl exists →
Show button:

RSVP on Luma

Under your Join Chat button.

Architecture Principle (Important)

Nearby Traveler = source of truth
Luma = RSVP infrastructure

Do NOT invert that.

What I Would Tell Replit Right Now

If it starts building complicated sync logic, stop it and say:

We are not syncing events from Luma.
We are only storing external RSVP URLs.
Luma is optional infrastructure.
Nearby Traveler remains the primary event system.

Now let me ask you something strategic:

Are you trying to:
A) Make LA look active immediately
or
B) Build a scalable external event ingestion system?

Because if it’s A (which I think it is), then this lightweight setup is exactly right.

If it’s B, we design something completely different.

Tell me which one you're optimizing for right now.

i want LA to look active, but i still dont understand why adding this will do that unless poeple can see all relevant LA events 

You’re right to question it. Adding a Luma link field alone will NOT make LA look active. It only helps per event once you already have events.

To make LA look active you need a big list of events showing on the LA page. There are only 3 ways to get that:

Option 1: Lots of events created inside Nearby Traveler (best)

Your LA page pulls from your NT events database.

You + ambassadors create 20–50 events (recurring is fine).

Each event auto-creates a chatroom (you already have this).

Optional: some events have “RSVP on Luma” for capacity/door list.

This makes LA look active because the NT feed is full.
Luma is just RSVP plumbing.

Fast hack to get volume:

Create recurring “templates” and spin them up:

Sunset meetup (weekly)

Coffee cowork (2x/week)

Hike (weekly)

Venice bar night (weekly)

“New in LA / visiting LA” (weekly)

“International friends” (weekly)

20 events = “active.” 5 events = “dead.”

Option 2: Embed an “Official LA” Luma calendar (cheap + instant)

This is the only way people can “see all relevant LA events” without API.

But it shows only the events on that Luma calendar — which again means you/ambassadors must populate it.

This can still make LA look active quickly because it’s a big list.
But it’s Luma UI inside your page.

Option 3: Pull events from other platforms (true aggregation)

To show “all relevant LA events” from everywhere, you need:

API access (paid/partner)

or scraping (not recommended)

or third-party sources like Eventbrite/Meetup (each has its own limitations)

That’s a bigger project.

The simplest truth

If your goal is “LA looks active”, you need event supply.

A Luma link doesn’t create supply. It only improves conversion/RSVP once supply exists.

What I’d do THIS week (lowest effort, max effect)

Make Nearby Traveler the feed (so it looks native)

Seed 30 LA events using recurring formats

For the 5–10 “official” ones, add Luma RSVP links

Add a filter on LA page: “This week / This weekend / Free / Outdoors / Nightlife”

Now LA looks alive.

If you want “all relevant LA events” without building a massive integration:

Let businesses + ambassadors submit events (in NT) and you moderate.
That’s how you scale supply without APIs.

If you tell me how many events you currently have showing in LA (roughly: 0–5, 5–20, 20+), I’ll tell you the fastest seeding plan to hit “active” by Friday without doing anything fancy.

i can put into my NT luma calander travel friendly events, i can do a constant search for hiking, biking, museums, etc events like that

Yes — that idea works, but the key is how you source them legally + efficiently.

The clean way to do it (and make LA look active fast)

Use Nearby Traveler as the event feed, and use your “NT Official LA” Luma calendar for the official curated picks that you’re comfortable putting your name/brand on.

Then populate your NT feed from 3 buckets:

Bucket 1: NT “Official Picks” (curated by you) ✅

These are travel-friendly events you personally select and post.

5–15 per week is enough to make LA feel alive

Put them on your Luma calendar too if you want RSVP/guest list/chat there

In NT, they get a badge: Official Pick

Bucket 2: Public events that you can list without scraping ✅

Use sources that are meant to be syndicated or shared:

LA city/county parks calendars

museum event calendars

public libraries

university public events

Event calendars with RSS/ICS feeds

ticketing platforms that provide shareable embeds/feeds

For these, in NT you list:

title, date/time, location, short description (in your own words)

link out to the official source for tickets/RSVP

Bucket 3: Community submissions ✅

Let ambassadors/businesses submit events directly in NT.
This scales your supply without you doing constant hunting.

What not to do

Avoid “constant searching” + copying from random event sites (especially ones like Eventbrite/Meetup) by scraping pages. That can create:

duplicate content issues

copyright/TOS issues

brittle scrapers that break weekly

You can still manually curate from those sites, but don’t build automation around scraping.

The workflow I’d set for you (simple + repeatable)
Weekly “LA Travel-Friendly Events” pipeline

Pick 5 categories:

Hiking/Outdoors

Museums/Art

Food/Markets

Live music/comedy

Fitness/wellness

Every Monday:

Add 10 curated events into NT

Mark 5 as “Official Picks”

Optionally mirror those 5 into Luma (RSVP list + chat)

In NT LA Events page:

Filters by category

“This weekend” toggle

“Free” tag

Result: LA looks active and the content feels on-brand.

Make it obvious to users what’s happening

On each event card, show one of these labels:

Official Pick (your Luma/curated)

Partner Event (business/venue posted)

Public Event (listed with link to source)

That prevents confusion like “why is this here / who hosts it?”

If you want, I’ll give you:

a standard event card template (copy/paste text fields)

a weekly list of LA sources to pull from (parks, museums, etc.)

Just tell me: are you trying to keep it only LA for now, or also add NYC soon?

LA city/county parks calendars

museum event calendars

public libraries

university public events

Event calendars with RSS/ICS feeds

ticketing platforms that provide shareable embeds/feeds

where do i get these to pull into the site automatically
Thought for 25s

You can only “pull automatically” if the source gives you a machine-readable feed (RSS or iCal/ICS). Good news: a bunch of LA civic/edu sites do.

Feeds you can use in LA (real, public)

Public libraries

Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) publishes an Events RSS feed (next ~50 upcoming).

LA County Library events page shows RSS and “Add to Calendar” options.

Universities

UCLA Library Public Programs calendar explicitly provides a link you can subscribe to “in any application that supports iCal.”

UCLA org calendars sometimes publish direct calendar subscription links (example: UCLA Faculty Association public calendar).

Parks / city & county

LA County Parks has an “Event Calendar” page, but not every parks calendar publishes a clean RSS/ICS feed you can reliably ingest (some are just web pages).
If there’s no RSS/ICS link on the page, you can’t “auto-pull” without scraping (not recommended).

How you wire this into Nearby Traveler (automatic)

On your backend (Replit/server), not iOS:

Create a table like event_sources with:

name, city, type (rss | ics), feed_url, refresh_minutes

A scheduled job runs every X hours:

fetch feed

parse RSS/ICS

normalize → insert/update into your events table

tag as Public Event + store source_url for “Get tickets/official info”

Reality check

Libraries + some university calendars are the easiest because RSS/ICS is common.

Museums / ticketing platforms often don’t provide RSS/ICS for full listings; you’ll either:

do manual curation, or

get partner/API access, or

embed their widgets (when available)

If you want, tell me which you want to start with (LAPL + LA County Library are the quickest wins), and I’ll outline the exact “source list” structure (fields + refresh cadence) so Replit can implement it cleanly without scraping.
