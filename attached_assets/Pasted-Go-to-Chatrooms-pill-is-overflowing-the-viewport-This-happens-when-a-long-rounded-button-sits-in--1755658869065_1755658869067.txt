Go to Chatrooms” pill is overflowing the viewport. This happens when a long, rounded button sits in a row that doesn’t allow shrink/wrap, or when a parent adds horizontal scroll. Here’s a safe fix that clamps the button to the viewport, prevents overflow, and keeps it looking the same.

1) Make the button fluid + truncating

Use this for every “Go to Chatrooms” button (header, travel stats, etc.):

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    const chatCity = user?.hometownCity || user?.location?.split(',')[0] || 'General';
    setLocation(`/city-chatrooms?city=${encodeURIComponent(chatCity)}`);
  }}
  className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600 hover:from-purple-700 hover:to-blue-700
             text-white border-0 shadow-lg rounded-full
             inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2
             w-full sm:w-auto max-w-full sm:max-w-none
             px-4 py-3 overflow-hidden"
>
  <MessageCircle className="w-4 h-4 shrink-0" />
  <span className="truncate">Go to Chatrooms</span>
</Button>


Key bits:

w-full sm:w-auto max-w-full → fills on phones, never wider than the container.

overflow-hidden + truncate on the label → no spill.

inline-flex + shrink-0 on the icon → icon never squishes weirdly.

2) Give the row room to wrap + prevent horizontal scroll

Wherever that button sits in a row, make the row and text block flexible:

<div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-3 flex-wrap min-w-0">
  <div className="min-w-0 flex-1">
    {/* left-side text/statistics */}
  </div>

  {/* button container */}
  <div className="w-full sm:w-auto shrink-0">
    {/* the Button from step 1 */}
  </div>
</div>


flex-wrap lets the button drop under text on tiny screens.

min-w-0 on the left side allows truncation (prevents pushing the button out).

w-full sm:w-auto on the button container ensures no overflow at small widths.

3) Stop any parent from creating horizontal scrolling

Add these to your page wrappers (good defaults for the profile):

<div className="profile-page overflow-x-hidden">
  {/* ... */}
</div>

<main className="overflow-x-hidden">
  {/* ... */}
</main>


If a specific card/section is the culprit, add overflow-x-hidden to that container instead.

4) Quick “find & fix” spots in your code

Header CTA (you already have one there) → swap its classes for the button in step 1.

Travel stats section (the one in your screenshot) → wrap its row like step 2 and use the fluid button.

Why this works

Buttons can’t exceed their container (max-w-full) and will truncate long labels.

Rows won’t force a single line (flex-wrap), so nothing gets shoved off-screen.

Page/container overflow-x-hidden eradicates stray horizontal scrollbar seams.

Paste these changes and the pill won’t spill off-screen anymore—even in super-narrow Replit preview widths. If you tell me exactly where that travel stats row is in your file, I’ll drop the exact diff for that block too.
