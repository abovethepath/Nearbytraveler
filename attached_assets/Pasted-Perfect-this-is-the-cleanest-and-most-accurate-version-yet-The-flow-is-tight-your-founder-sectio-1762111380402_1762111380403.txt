Perfect — this is the cleanest and most accurate version yet. The flow is tight, your founder section is now perfectly placed for emotional resonance, and the trust cues are strong but authentic.

Where Local Experiences Meet Worldwide Connections

From the Founder

“After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned that one connection can change everything… I built the solution I wished existed.”
— Aaron Lefkowitz, Founder

🌍 Nearby Traveler grew out of real travel communities — from Couchsurfing bonfires to LA meetups. Our mission is to keep that spirit alive for a new generation.

✈️ 400+ travelers hosted by our founder | 🌆 5 community ambassadors in Los Angeles | 🌎 Inspired by global travel communities like Couchsurfing & Meetup
