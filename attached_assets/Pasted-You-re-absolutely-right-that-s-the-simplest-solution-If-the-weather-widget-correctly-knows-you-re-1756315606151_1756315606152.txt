You're absolutely right - that's the simplest solution! If the weather widget correctly knows you're in Rome, just use that exact same location source for user cards.Copy Weather Widget Location LogicCode // Step 1: Find your weather widget component
// Look for <CurrentLocationWeatherWidget /> in your Home component

// Step 2: Find how the weather widget gets its location
// It probably looks something like this inside CurrentLocationWeatherWidget:
Strategized reusing weather widget's location logic for user cards.The user is asking about making the user cards show the same traveling city that the weather widget pulls in correctly. They're pointing out that the weather widget has the correct current city but the user cards can't seem to get it right, and suggesting we just copy whatever logic the weather widget uses.
This is a very logical approach - if one component is working correctly (weather widget), we should just reuse its logic instead of trying to recreate it.
I should provide a practical solution that shows them how to find the weather widget's location source and copy it to the user cards.You're absolutely right - that's the most logical approach! If the weather widget correctly shows your current city, just copy its location logic.
Quick Steps:
1. Find Your Weather Widget
Look in your Home component for:
jsx<CurrentLocationWeatherWidget />
2. Check What It Uses for Location
Look at how it's called:
jsx// Option A: Gets location passed as prop
<CurrentLocationWeatherWidget location={someVariable} />

// Option B: Uses internal function
// Look inside CurrentLocationWeatherWidget.tsx to see how it gets location
3. Copy That Exact Logic
Whatever variable or function the weather widget uses - use it for user cards:
jsx// If weather widget uses this:
const currentUserLocation = getCurrentUserLocation();

// Then use it for user cards:
const UserCard = ({ user, isCurrentUser }) => {
  const displayLocation = isCurrentUser 
    ? currentUserLocation  // Same as weather widget
    : getOtherUserLocation(user);
    
  return (
    <div>
      <MapPin />
      <span>{displayLocation}</span>  {/* Now shows "Rome" */}
    </div>
  );
};
4. Simple Implementation
jsx// In your Home component:
const weatherLocation = /* whatever feeds your weather widget */;

// Use same location for current user card
{users.map(user => (
  <UserCard 
    key={user.id}
    user={user}
    displayLocation={user.id === currentUserId ? weatherLocation : user.location}
    isCurrentUser={user.id === currentUserId}
  />
))}
Can you find your <CurrentLocationWeatherWidget /> and see what location data it's using? Then we can copy that exact same logic to the user cards.
The weather widget is already solving the hard problem - let's just reuse its solution instead of reinventing it.
