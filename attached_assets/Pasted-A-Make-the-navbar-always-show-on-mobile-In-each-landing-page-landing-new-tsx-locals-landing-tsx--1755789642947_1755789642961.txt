A) Make the navbar always show on mobile

In each landing page (landing-new.tsx, locals-landing.tsx, events-landing.tsx, business-landing.tsx, travelers-landing.tsx) replace your <header …> and add a spacer right after it.

Replace:

<header className="sticky top-12 md:top-0 z-[55] bg-white shadow-sm">…</header>


With:

{/* Fixed navbar that sits under the orange banner on phones */}
<header className="fixed inset-x-0 top-12 md:top-0 z-[70] bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-900/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-white/70 dark:supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-gray-900/70">
  <div className="pt-2">
    <LandingNavbar />
  </div>
</header>

{/* spacer so content doesn't slide under the fixed header */}
<div className="h-[64px] md:h-[72px]" />


And make sure the orange announcement bar is mobile-only so it doesn’t double-stack with the header on desktop:

Change the orange bar wrapper to:

<div className="md:hidden fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-[60] bg-orange-500 text-black py-3 px-4 shadow-lg">


(You already did this on one page; apply to the others.)

Why this works: the old sticky header was getting clipped/hidden by overlapping containers and the fixed banner. Using a fixed header with a spacer guarantees visibility on every device.

B) Tame the hero on phones (show the image, keep text readable)

Make these two tweaks to each landing page hero:

Use fluid font sizes and tighter spacing on mobile.

Hide the heavy “founder/credibility” card on xs screens (it’s what blocks the image).

Example patch for client/src/pages/landing-new.tsx

Find your <h1> block and replace it with:

<h1 className="px-2 sm:px-4 leading-tight sm:leading-snug">
  <span className="block font-black text-[clamp(1.6rem,6vw,2.5rem)] text-white">
    Skip the Tourist Traps.
  </span>
  <span className="block font-black text-[clamp(1.4rem,5.5vw,2.25rem)]">
    <span className="text-amber-300 sm:text-orange-500">Meet Locals and Other </span>
    <span className="text-blue-300 sm:text-blue-600">Nearby Travelers </span>
    <span className="text-white sm:text-black">Right Now, Today!!!</span>
  </span>
</h1>


Then wrap the large black quote box with hidden sm:block so it doesn’t show on phones:

{/* Personal credibility as founder (hide on phones so the hero photo is visible) */}
<div className="hidden sm:block mt-8 p-6 bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl border border-white/20">
  …
</div>


And ensure the hero overlay doesn’t over-darken the image on phones:

<div
  className="absolute inset-0 sm:bg-gray-800/70"
  style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,.55), rgba(0,0,0,.25), rgba(0,0,0,0))' }}
  aria-hidden="true"
/>


You can reuse the same two edits (fluid headings + hidden sm:block on the big card) in:

locals-landing.tsx

events-landing.tsx

business-landing.tsx

travelers-landing.tsx

If a page doesn’t have that big card, just apply the fluid <h1> change.

C) (Optional) Stop any overflow on phones

Add (or confirm you have) this in your global CSS:

/* Prevent horizontal scroll sitewide on mobile */
html, body {
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

Quick sanity check (takes 30 seconds)

Reload a landing page on your phone (or the dev mobile emulator).

You should immediately see the navbar under the orange strip.

The photo is visible, and the headline scales to the screen.

Opening the mobile menu shows links (Home / For Locals / Travelers / Events / Business).

If anything still hides the header, bump its z-index one step: z-[80] on the <header>.
