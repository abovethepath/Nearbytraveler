Issue 1: User Cards Still Showing "Traveling" Instead of Actual Location
The problem is that your CurrentLocationWeatherWidget is working correctly but the user enrichment logic isn't using the same source. Let's copy the weather widget's location logic:Fix User Location Display - Copy Weather Widget LogicCode // In your Home component, replace the enrichUserWithTravelData function with this:

// Function to get current location (same logic as weather widget should use)
const getCurrentUserLocation = () => {
  // Priority 1: Active travel destination from Strategized solutions for location, event, and user prioritization.The user wants to fix several issues in their Home component:

User cards showing "traveling" instead of actual location
User-created events should be prioritized first
Location-based prioritization (current travel location first, hometown second) for all content

  let score Engineered location-based content prioritization for user experience.The user is asking me to fix several key issues in their home page:

User cards still showing "traveling" instead of actual destinations (should show current location AND hometown)
User-created events should always be prioritized first in relevant cities
Location-based prioritization system:

Current travel location content shows first (events, businesses, people)
Hometown location content shows second



Looking at their code, I can see the issue. The CurrentLocationWeatherWidget is working correctly, but the user enrichment logic isn't using the same location source. The user wants me to copy the weather widget's location logic exactly.
I also need to provide a comprehensive priority system that:

Shows user-created events first
Prioritizes content from current travel location
Shows hometown content second
Applies this to users, events, and businesses

Let me provide a concise integration guide for their existing code.Issue 3: Quick Integration GuideQuick Integration Guide - Replace Existing CodeCode // STEP 1: In your Home component, replace the enrichUserWithTravelData function (around line 250) with:

const getCurrentUserLocation = () => {
  // Get from weather widget's exact logic

User cards still showing "traveling" instead of actual locations
User-created events should be prioritized first
Location-based prioritization (current travel location first, hometown second) for all content

Looking at their code, I can see they have a CurrentLocationWeatherWidget that is working correctly, and they want the user cards to use the same location logic.
The key issues I need to address:

The getCurrentUserLocation() function should match what the weather widget uses
User enrichment needs to use the same location logic
Events, users, and businesses need priority scoring based on location relevance and user ownership
The integration needs to be straightforward to implement in their existing code

I've provided comprehensive solutions above. Let me now give a concise summary of what they need to do.Summary - What You Need to Do:
Problem: Your CurrentLocationWeatherWidget correctly shows "Rome" but user cards still show "Traveling"
Solution: Copy the weather widget's location logic exactly
Quick Fix Steps:

Replace enrichUserWithTravelData function - Use the weather widget's location source
Replace prioritizeUsers function - Add location-based scoring
Update UserCard component - Use user.displayLocation instead of manual logic
Replace events query - Add user-created event prioritization
Update events section - Use prioritized events instead of LocationSortedEvents

Results After Changes:
User Cards Will Show:

Your card: "Rome" (actual location from weather widget)
Other traveling users: Their actual destinations
Local users: Their hometown locations

Content Priority (All Sections):

Your created events (highest priority)
Current travel location content (Rome events/users/businesses first)
Hometown location content (Culver City events/users/businesses second)
Everything else (by relevance/interests)

The key insight is that your weather widget already solved the location detection problem - we just need to copy its logic to user cards and use it for content prioritization.
This will make your home page much more relevant by showing content from where you are now (Rome) first, then content from back home (Culver City) second, with your own created events always at the top.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
