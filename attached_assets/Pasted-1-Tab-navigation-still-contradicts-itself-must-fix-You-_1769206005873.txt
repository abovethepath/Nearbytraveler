1) 🔥 Tab navigation still contradicts itself (must fix)

You have three different tab specs in the doc:

Earlier “Navigation Tabs (Bottom)” (locals/travelers): Home / Messages / Chatrooms / Search / Profile

Recommended tab structure (regular): Home / Events / Chatrooms / Messages / Profile

Business tabs earlier: Dashboard / Messages / Create Deal / Search / Profile

Final business tabs: Dashboard / Deals / Messages / Search / Profile

✅ Fix: make ONE source of truth and delete the others.

Use this everywhere (matches your “FINAL TAB STRUCTURE”):

Regular: Home | Events | Chatrooms | Messages | Profile

Search is a modal/screen launched from Home (filter/search icon), not a bottom tab.

Business: Dashboard | Deals | Messages | Search | Profile

“Create Deal / Flash Deal” is via FAB, not a bottom tab.

2) 🔥 Photo upload format contradicts itself (must fix)

You correctly show multipart FormData in “Media Upload Flow”:

formData.append('photo', { uri, type, name })

But later under endpoints you wrote:

PUT /api/users/:id/profile-photo (body: {imageData})

POST /api/users/:id/cover-photo (body: {imageData})

✅ Fix: pick one. If your backend is already working with the web app, it’s almost certainly multipart.

Replace those endpoint notes with:

PUT /api/users/:id/profile-photo - multipart/form-data with field "photo"

POST /api/users/:id/cover-photo - multipart/form-data with field "photo"

(If you also support base64 JSON, label it explicitly as “alternate payload supported” instead of replacing multipart.)

3) ⚠️ connectionStatus drives CTAs, but you never define values (add a tiny enum)

You say “connectionStatus drive UI badges/CTAs” but only show "none" in the sample.

✅ Add this mini spec so nobody invents behavior:

connectionStatus enum → UI

none → Connect

outgoing_pending → Requested

incoming_pending → Accept

connected → Message

blocked → Hidden everywhere

(Use whatever your backend actually returns—just define it here.)

4) ⚠️ You added new endpoints that might be invented (danger for your “do not invent endpoints” rule)

These are risky unless you’re 100% sure they exist:

POST /api/support/private-reference

PATCH/DELETE /api/user-references/:referenceId

GET /api/user-references/check/:reviewerId/:revieweeId

DELETE /api/users/profile-photo

DELETE /api/users/:id (account deletion)

✅ Fix: Either:

Remove them from the prompt, OR

Mark them explicitly as “ONLY if implemented on backend (optional)” and do not block MVP.

For account deletion specifically, your safest wording is:

“If DELETE /api/users/:id is not available, implement ‘Request deletion’ by opening WebView to /settings or emailing support.”

Optional (but smart) 2-line clarifications

These prevent real-world Expo/RN auth headaches:

Cookie auth on React Native

Add:

“RN fetch does not reliably persist cookies by default. Use @react-native-cookies/cookies and a single API wrapper that always includes cookies + credentials:'include'.”

WebSocket auth

You already have the auth message format — great. Add:

“Do not assume cookies are automatically sent in the WS handshake; always send the {type:'auth', userId, sessionId} message after connect.”

If you make just those 4 fixes (tabs, upload format, connectionStatus enum, and “optional endpoints” labeling), this prompt becomes bulletproof for a Replit Expo iOS build.
