60-second fix checklist

Close the hero (or any section above 2886). Add a </section> just before line 2886 as a test. If the error moves or disappears, the hero was unclosed.

Ensure you’re inside a single return ( … ). If your <div className="w-full…"> at 2886 is outside the existing return, you’ll get this error. Add the missing ) and ; above it, or move this <div> inside the existing return.

Wrap siblings with a fragment. You can’t have two top-level JSX siblings. Wrap multiple sections in <> … </>.

Close any map blocks. Every {items.map(x => ( … ))} needs )) and a closing }.

Known-good scaffold (drop-in around your content)

Paste this around the area and move your blocks into the labeled spots. It guarantees a single root and all tags closed.

// profile.tsx
export default function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* ===== HERO (make sure this section is fully closed) ===== */}
      {/* <section> ...your hero content... </section> */}

      {/* ===== MAIN LAYOUT (the part around line ~2886) ===== */}
      <div className="w-full max-w-full mx-auto pb-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          {/* Main Content Column */}
          <div className="lg:col-span-2 space-y-4">
            {/* Move your main content blocks here */}
            {/* Example:
              <SomeBlock />
              {items.map(item => (
                <Card key={item.id}>...</Card>
              ))}  // <-- ensure both )) and } exist
            */}
          </div>

          {/* Sidebar */}
          <aside className="space-y-4">
            {/* Move your sidebar content here */}
          </aside>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

Quick “find the culprit” tricks

Add a temporary </section> just before 2886. If build succeeds, you forgot to close one above.

Format the file (Prettier). It often jumps to the exact unclosed block.

Binary comment: comment out blocks above 2886 by halves until it compiles; the last uncommented block is the offender.

Bracket match: put the cursor on each opening tag/paren above; if your editor can’t find a match, that’s the one.

If you paste ~30 lines above and below 2886 (especially where your hero ends and where return ( begins), I’ll mark the exact tag/paren you need to close.
