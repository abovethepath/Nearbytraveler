Hey — I see the current City Picks flow in your screenshots. You’re very close. Here’s what I’d tell Replit to do next for the AI + “show everything on one page” approach (no extra tabs/pages).

What to change on the City Picks page (based on your screenshots)
1) Make the City-specific section “real” (not just AI)

Right now your first big section is “Los Angeles Metro Activities” with an AI button, but the list underneath is a mix of:

city landmarks/places ✅

generic stuff (Trivia Nights, Rooftop Bars, Craft Beer Scene, etc.) ❌ (those belong in the universal set)

Fix: split City-specific into two visible groups (still one page):

Popular in {City} (Static/Featured) → 8–12 items (curated)

More {City} Ideas (AI) → generated in batches of 6

2) Keep universal (20) at bottom (you already did) ✅

But hide/remove those random gray “DUNE JUMPING / SINGLE / etc” chips sitting above Universal — they confuse the whole page. Those belong in profile/preferences or are legacy.

3) Add two sticky helpers (huge UX win)

Sticky bar: Selected (n) | Clear | Done

Search within City Picks: “Search city picks…”

Paste this to Replit (AI implementation instructions)

Implement AI suggestions properly on City Picks

Add “Featured/Popular” city list

In city_activities, add fields if missing:

source: 'featured' | 'ai' | 'user' (string ok)

isFeatured boolean (or use source='featured')

rank int (for ordering)

On page load, query:

featured = city_activities WHERE city_id=? AND source='featured' ORDER BY rank LIMIT 12

ai = city_activities WHERE city_id=? AND source='ai' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 60

user = city_activities WHERE city_id=? AND source='user'

AI button behavior (batch + dedupe)

Rename button to: “Suggest 6 more ideas”

On click:

call POST /api/cities/:cityId/activities/generate with { count: 6, exclude: [all names already shown] }

server generates only city-specific places/experiences (no generic universals)

server dedupes against:

universal 20

existing city activities (featured/ai/user)

exclude list

server inserts new rows with source='ai'

client appends results inline under the AI section

Hard rule: AI must NOT generate universal-style items
Block these patterns server-side after generation:

anything too generic like “Night Markets”, “Rooftop Bars”, “Trivia Nights”, “Craft Beer Scene”, “Food Halls”, “Street Food Tours”
Those are universal intents. AI should output things like:

specific markets (e.g., “Grand Central Market”)

specific venues (e.g., “Hollywood Bowl”)

specific neighborhoods (e.g., “Silver Lake”)

specific attractions (e.g., “The Getty Center”)

One-page layout
Order sections exactly:

Popular in {City} (featured)

More ideas (AI) (button + AI results)

All City Picks (optional: everything else, still on same page)

Universal Match Preferences (20)

Remove/relocate the legacy gray chips
The gray chips like “DUNE JUMPING / SINGLE / FAMILY FRIENDLY / BUSINESS NETWORKING” should not appear in the city list area. Keep dating/family as profile or trip context.
