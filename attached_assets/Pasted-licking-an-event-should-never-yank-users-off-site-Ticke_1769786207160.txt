licking an event should never yank users off-site. Ticketmaster should be secondary, not the primary click.

Fix the flow (what it should do)
Default click on an event card

✅ Adds it to “Your Picks” (as an Event)

Show a toast: “Added to Your Picks (Interested)”

The card visually toggles “Selected”

Secondary action to open Ticketmaster

Put a small button/link on the card:

“Details / Tickets” (opens Ticketmaster in a new tab)

Or a small external-link icon

Result: primary = matching intent, secondary = ticket purchase.

How to implement (tell Replit)
1) Change the event card to two actions

Entire card: onClick => toggleInterested(eventId)

“Tickets” button: <a href=... target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tickets</a>

2) Store Ticketmaster events as “external events” in your DB

Create a table or reuse existing events model with fields like:

source='ticketmaster'

externalId

name

startDateTime

venueName

cityId

url (Ticketmaster link)

imageUrl
Then create a join table:

user_event_interest with userId, eventId, status (Interested/Going)

3) Show external events inside “Your Picks”

In Your Picks, show them with a badge:

Event • Interested
Buttons:

Tickets

Remove

Why the events feel random (and how to make them better)
Add 2 filters immediately

Date filter: default to next 14 days, not 30

Category filter: default to Music + Festivals + Comedy + Sports (hide niche)

Personalize using the user’s picks

If user selected:

Live Music → show mostly concerts

Sports interests → show sports

Comedy Shows → show comedy

Put it lower on the page (agree)

Order should be:

Your Picks

Popular

AI Ideas / Suggested

Events (Next 30 days) (bottom)

Because events are “nice to have” and noisy unless personalized.

Copy/paste prompt to Replit

“Change Ticketmaster event cards so clicking adds/removes the event to ‘Your Picks’ as an external event interest (status=Interested). Do not navigate away on card click. Add a separate ‘Tickets/Details’ button/icon that opens Ticketmaster in a new tab. Store external events in DB (source=ticketmaster, externalId, name, datetime, venue, url, image) and store user interest in a join table. Move the Events section below AI Ideas and filter/personalize events (default next 14 days; prefer music/festivals/comedy/sports; weight by user’s selected preferences).”

If you tell me whether you already have an events table in your backend, I can suggest the smallest schema change (either reuse it or add external_events + user_event_interest).
