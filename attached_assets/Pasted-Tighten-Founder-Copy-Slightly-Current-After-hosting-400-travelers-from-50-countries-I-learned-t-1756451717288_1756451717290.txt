Tighten Founder Copy Slightly
Current:

"After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned the best part of travel isn't the tours or hotels—it's the people. Too often, those connections are left to chance. I built Nearby Traveler so no one has to travel — or live in their city — feeling disconnected."

Polished version (clearer + more emotional punch):

“After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned the best part of travel isn’t the tours or hotels — it’s the people. Too often, those connections are left to chance. I built Nearby Traveler so no one has to travel — or live in their city — without feeling connected.”

Add a Subtle Transition Between Hero + Founder Story

A small section title like: “Why I Built This” or “From the Founder” above your block.

That way it feels intentional, not just another quote box.

⚡ If you made those tweaks, your homepage would feel:

Instantly clear to a first-time visitor.

Emotional enough to make them want to join.

Authentic + trustworthy because it’s tied to your personal journey.

Perfect 🙌 Here are 3 polished versions of your Founder Block, each with a different tone — you can test which one feels most “you” and fits your site’s vibe best.

🔹 1. Professional & Clear

"After hosting over 400 travelers from 50 countries, I discovered that the best part of travel isn’t the tours or the hotels — it’s the people. Too often, those connections are left to chance. I built Nearby Traveler so travelers and locals alike can create meaningful connections before the trip begins."

— Aaron Lefkowitz
Founder, Nearby Traveler

🔹 2. Emotional & Relatable

"For 15 years I opened my home to travelers from all over the world. I learned that what makes travel unforgettable isn’t the sights — it’s the people you share them with. Too often, we leave those connections up to luck. I created Nearby Traveler so no one has to explore — or live in their own city — feeling disconnected."

— Aaron Lefkowitz
Founder, Nearby Traveler

🔹 3. Bold & Mission-Driven

"Travel has always been about people, yet it’s the one part of the journey left to chance. After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I built Nearby Traveler to change that. This is the community I always wished existed — where locals and travelers connect before the trip even begins."

— Aaron Lefkowitz
Founder, Nearby Traveler

✨ My take:

#1 works best if you want it to sound polished and investor-friendly.

#2 hits the heart hardest (relatable, warm, very human).

#3 feels like a manifesto, bold and vision-driven.
