You don’t have to use Railway. For your stack (Node/Express + native ws + Redis + Neon) the “best” host mostly comes down to how much ops you’re willing to do vs how much headroom you want.

Here are the top options that actually fit WebSockets + scaling (and the ones to avoid).

My top recommendation for you: Render

Why: it’s the best “production-grade but still simple” choice for a realtime app.

Inbound WebSockets supported on normal web services.

Built-in scaling options.

Predictable-ish pricing model (plan + compute).

If you want “best” with minimal complexity: pick Render.

What you do next (Render):

Create Render account → “New Web Service” → connect your GitHub repo

Set build/start commands + env vars

Add custom domain nearbytraveler.org + update DNS

Best performance/control for realtime: Fly.io

Why: excellent for long-lived WebSocket connections and scaling geographically.

Fly explicitly supports WebSockets.

Usage-based pricing model.

Tradeoff: you’ll do a bit more “infra-ish” work (CLI, regions, machine sizing).

What you do next (Fly.io):

Create Fly account + install CLI

fly launch from your repo, set secrets/env

Add Redis (or point to existing), scale machines, point domain

“Big cloud, most scalable” option: Amazon Web Services (ECS/Fargate) + Application Load Balancer

Why: maximum control, maximum headroom. Great if you expect to become huge.

ALB has native WebSocket support.

Tradeoff: most setup (VPC, ECS service, task defs, logging, autoscaling). It’s the “best” technically, but not the best if you want to move fast.

Strong serverless contender: Google Cloud Run

Official docs cover running WebSockets and best practices.

Tradeoff: WebSockets + serverless can get tricky/expensive if you have tons of long-lived connections unless you configure concurrency/min instances carefully (still doable, just more “cloud tuning”).

“Okay, but not my first pick”: DigitalOcean App Platform

WebSockets can work (commonly via wss:// on 443).
I’d put it behind Render/Fly for your specific “chat-heavy day-one spike” scenario.

Avoid for your current architecture: Vercel (for the backend)

Vercel’s serverless model generally doesn’t support persistent WebSocket connections for your kind of backend.
(You can still host the frontend there, but keep chat/API elsewhere.)

What I would do in your shoes (fast + “best” outcome)

Pick Render if you want the best blend of:

“deploy today”

WebSockets supported

scalable enough for your launch

not a DevOps project

Pick Fly.io if you want:

the best realtime performance/control

and you don’t mind a bit more setup

Since you already pushed to GitHub: your next 3 moves

Choose host (Render or Fly are my top 2)

Create account + connect GitHub repo

Add env vars + deploy, then point nearbytraveler.org to it

If you tell me which one you want (Render or Fly), I’ll give you the exact click-by-click + the exact build/start settings to use for a typical Vite+Express monorepo (and the common gotchas that cause first deploys to fail).
