From the Founder

“After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned that one connection can change everything.
Travelers spend billions on flights and hotels, yet the most valuable part — the people you meet — is left to chance.
I built the solution I wished existed.”

— Aaron Lefkowitz, Founder

🌍 Nearby Traveler grew out of real travel communities — from Couchsurfing bonfires to local meetups in Los Angeles. Our mission is to keep that spirit alive for a new generation.
