Yes — you need a personalization layer that asks follow-up questions and surfaces the right city picks without making people scroll.

The feature: “Suggested for you” (contextual follow-ups)

Put a small section right under “Popular in {City}”:

✨ Suggested for you
“Based on what you picked…”

It appears after the user selects their first 1–2 items (so it doesn’t feel random).

How it works (simple + effective)

When someone selects a universal like Guided Tours, you immediately show 3–5 quick add suggestions:

“Since you picked Guided Tours…”

✅ Ghost Tour

✅ Street Art Walk

✅ Architecture Walking Tour

✅ (City-specific) Hollywood Sign Hike Tour (if LA)

Each suggestion is a chip/card with Add.

Where each suggestion should come from

Use this priority order:

From your existing city list (best)

If the city already has “Hollywood Sign Hike”, “Ghost Tours”, etc. → recommend those directly.

If not found, call AI to generate 3–5 specific items
But constrain AI to return named, city-specific options (proper nouns).

What to tell Replit to implement (copy/paste)
1) Add a “Smart Suggestions” component

Location: under “Popular in {City}”

Trigger: when selectedCount >= 1

Input: selectedUniversal[], selectedCityPicks[], cityName, existingCityActivities[]

Output: show 3–5 suggestions max

2) Add a mapping table (no AI needed most of the time)

Example mappings:

Guided Tours → Ghost Tour, Architecture Walk, Street Art Walk, Famous Landmark Tour

Hiking & Nature → Best viewpoint hike, iconic trail, nearby nature spot

Beach / Waterfront → Best beach/boardwalk/pier, waterfront sunset spot

Museums & Galleries → top 2–3 museums in city

Nightlife & Dancing → 1–2 famous nightlife streets/areas (named neighborhoods)

3) City-specific lookup first

For each mapped suggestion, try to find a match in city_activities:

If found → recommend that exact item

If not found → AI generates a named alternative

4) AI prompt (short + strict)

“Return 5 named, city-specific suggestions for {city}. Each must include a proper noun (place/neighborhood/venue). Do NOT return generic items like ‘Food Hall Tastings’, ‘Night Markets’, ‘Bar Crawls’. Output JSON only.”

5) UX interaction

Each suggestion has Add (toggles like other picks)

Add a tiny “Why?” tooltip: “Because you picked Guided Tours”

Bonus (this solves your earlier problem)

This is also where you can safely include the “banned” generic concepts as questions, not AI spam:

“Interested in a ghost tour?” (universal/optional)

“Want a landmark hike tour?” (city-specific)

If you want, tell me which 6–8 universals you care most about (Guided Tours, Hiking, Nightlife, Museums, etc.) and I’ll write the exact mapping list for each so Replit can implement it without guessing.
