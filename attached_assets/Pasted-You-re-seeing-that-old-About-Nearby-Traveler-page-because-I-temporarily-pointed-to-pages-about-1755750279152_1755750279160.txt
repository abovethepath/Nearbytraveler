You’re seeing that old “About Nearby Traveler” page because I temporarily pointed / to ./pages/about (it was the only safe page that rendered when we were unblocking the white-screen). Let’s put your real home page back.

Fix (1 file): point / to your actual Home

Replace client/src/App.tsx with this (keeps your auth exports + routes, but sets Home = ./pages/home; the old About page is now only at /about):

// client/src/App.tsx
// Back-compat exports so existing imports still work
export { AuthContext, useAuth, AuthProvider } from "./auth-context";

import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
import { Route, Switch } from "wouter";
import AppShell from "./ui/AppShell";
import GlobalHotfixes from "./GlobalHotfixes";

// ✅ Use your real Home
const Home                 = lazy(() => import("./pages/home"));
// Keep About but NOT as the default route
const About                = lazy(() => import("./pages/about"));

// Other pages you listed
const ProfilePage          = lazy(() => import("./pages/ProfilePageResponsive"));
const Chatroom             = lazy(() => import("./pages/chatroom"));
const CityChatrooms        = lazy(() => import("./pages/city-chatrooms"));
const EventsListResponsive = lazy(() => import("./pages/EventsListResponsive"));
const TravelIntentQuiz     = lazy(() => import("./pages/TravelIntentQuiz"));
const BusinessDashboard    = lazy(() => import("./pages/business-dashboard"));
const BusinessLanding      = lazy(() => import("./pages/business-landing"));
const BusinessOffers       = lazy(() => import("./pages/business-offers"));
const BusinessProfile      = lazy(() => import("./pages/business-profile"));
const BusinessRegistration = lazy(() => import("./pages/business-registration"));
const AuthPage             = lazy(() => import("./pages/auth"));
const AiCompanion          = lazy(() => import("./pages/ai-companion"));
const NotFound             = lazy(() => import("./pages/NotFound").catch(() => import("./pages/home")));

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AppShell>
      <GlobalHotfixes />
      <Suspense fallback={<div className="p-4">Loading…</div>}>
        <Switch>
          {/* ✅ REAL HOME */}
          <Route path="/" component={Home} />

          {/* About is available explicitly */}
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />

          {/* Profile */}
          <Route path="/profile/:id">
            {(params) => <ProfilePage userId={Number(params.id)} />}
          </Route>

          {/* Chatrooms */}
          <Route path="/chatroom" component={Chatroom} />
          <Route path="/chatrooms/:city" component={CityChatrooms as any} />

          {/* Discovery / Events / Quiz */}
          <Route path="/events" component={EventsListResponsive} />
          <Route path="/quiz" component={TravelIntentQuiz} />

          {/* Business */}
          <Route path="/business-dashboard" component={BusinessDashboard} />
          <Route path="/business-landing" component={BusinessLanding} />
          <Route path="/business-offers" component={BusinessOffers} />
          <Route path="/business-profile" component={BusinessProfile} />
          <Route path="/business-registration" component={BusinessRegistration} />

          {/* Auth & tools */}
          <Route path="/auth" component={AuthPage} />
          <Route path="/ai-companion" component={AiCompanion} />

          {/* 404 */}
          <Route component={NotFound} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </AppShell>
  );
}

Build & run (no WS needed)
cd client && npx vite build --mode production --sourcemap && cd ..
NODE_ENV=production node server/index.prod.js


Open / — you should see your current Home (from pages/home.tsx), not the old About page. If your home file lives under a different path, swap the import to match what you saw in the Dev Page Explorer (e.g. ./pages/Home with capital H).

Why this happened: during triage I mapped / → about to get something rendering. This patch restores your intended homepage while keeping everything else and your mobile infra intact.
