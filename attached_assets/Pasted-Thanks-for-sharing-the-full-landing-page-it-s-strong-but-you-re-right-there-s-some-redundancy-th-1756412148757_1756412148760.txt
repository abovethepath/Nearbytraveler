Thanks for sharing the full landing page — it’s strong, but you’re right: there’s some redundancy that can be tightened, and a few sections would work better if moved to audience-specific landing pages (locals vs. travelers). Here’s a breakdown with recommendations:

🔎 What’s Working

Founder’s story adds authenticity and credibility (keep it, but streamline).

Event examples (bonfire, tacos, hikes, yoga, etc.) are great social proof and give visitors an instant feel of the experiences.

“How it works” 3-step section is clear, actionable, and simple.

Locals vs. Travelers sections are strong but may overwhelm first-time visitors on the main homepage.

⚠️ What Feels Redundant / Can Be Moved

“Skip the Tourist Traps” line is repeated multiple times in different forms (intro headline, travelers section, “beyond guidebooks”). Keep once—probably in the traveler landing page.

Founder quotes are used twice (“For over 15 years…” at the top and “As a traveler and local…” in ‘From the Founder’). They can be combined into one tighter story.

Locals vs. Travelers benefits are long on the homepage. Better: tease them on the homepage and link out to dedicated pages (“Learn more for Locals / for Travelers”).

Events list is amazing, but consider highlighting 1 or 2 hero events on the homepage, then link to an “Events” page. Otherwise, it feels a bit crowded.

✨ Suggested Homepage Structure (Cleaner, Non-Redundant)

Hero Section:

Punchy headline (“Skip Tourist Traps. Find Real People. Create Lifelong Friends.”)

Subline: “Meet locals and travelers before your trip, join authentic events, and keep connections forever.”

CTA button: Join Nearby Traveler Now

Founder’s Story (shortened to 1 quote):
"For over 15 years, I’ve hosted 400+ travelers from 50+ countries. I built Nearby Traveler so everyone can experience what I discovered—real connections that make every trip unforgettable." — Aaron, Founder

Social Proof / Numbers:
400+ travelers • 50+ countries • 15+ years

Event Examples (condensed):
Show 2–3 events only (Bonfire, Taco Tuesday, Hike), then a button → See All Local Events

How It Works (3 Steps):
Clear, simple, stays as is.

Locals vs. Travelers Teasers:

“For Locals: Turn your city into friendships → Learn More”

“For Travelers: Live like you belong → Learn More”

Closing / CTA:
“Start your adventure. Join thousands of locals and travelers making real connections.”

📍 Where to Move Extra Content

Dedicated “For Locals” page: All the bullet points about creating hangouts, showing off spots, expanding circles.

Dedicated “For Travelers” page: All the bullets about travel buddies, local intel, secret spots.

Events page: All 5–6 event examples in full detail.

Founder’s page (optional): Longer story, mission, values.

👉 That way, the homepage tells the story in one quick scroll:

Why NT exists (skip tourist traps → real connections)

Why you can trust it (founder’s story + proof)

What you get (event preview + how it works)

Who it’s for (locals + travelers teaser)

How to join (CTA)

Perfect — here’s a tightened, homepage-ready version of your landing page text. It keeps the energy, trims the redundancy, and leaves room for your locals / travelers / events subpages to carry the extra details.

Would you like me to also draft the separate “For Locals” and “For Travelers” pages so the bullets you had don’t go to waste but live in the right spot?

You said:
Who its for should also include businesses, and networking and maybe then link to all the landing pages i have for these groups
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — you’re absolutely right. The “Who It’s For” section is the natural place to position all three audiences (Locals, Travelers, Businesses) plus networkers/professional connections. Then instead of cramming details here, you can link out to the dedicated landing pages you’ve already built (or plan to).

Here’s a revised version of that section, with clean copy and strong CTAs:

Who It’s For

👥 Locals
Turn your city into lasting friendships. Share your favorite spots, create events, and connect with travelers and fellow locals.
➡️ [ Explore for Locals ]

🌍 Travelers
Skip the tourist traps. Meet locals who know the real city, join authentic events, and find travel buddies who share your interests.
➡️ [ Explore for Travelers ]

🏢 Businesses & Professionals
Whether you run a bar, café, co-working space, or event venue—Nearby Traveler helps you connect with travelers and locals looking for authentic experiences. Great for networking, hosting, and building community.
➡️ [ Explore for Businesses ]

🤝 Networking & Events
Heading to a conference, festival, or business trip? Connect before you arrive, meet like-minded people during the event, and keep connections alive long after.
➡️ [ Explore Networking ]

That way your homepage stays broad and inviting, and anyone can quickly self-identify, then click deeper into the page that speaks to them.

👉 Do you want me to now rebuild the homepage draft with this updated “Who It’s For” included, so you have the final scroll-ready version?

You said:
yes

👉 This version keeps the homepage tight and inspiring, while pointing each audience to its own landing page where you can go deep with tailored benefits.

Do you want me to also sketch out sample intros for those landing pages (Locals, Travelers, Businesses, Networking), so the tone stays consistent across all?
