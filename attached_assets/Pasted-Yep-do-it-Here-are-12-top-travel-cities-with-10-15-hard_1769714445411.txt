How to “hard code” this cleanly (so it always shows)

Best way (still feels hard-coded): store it in DB with a flag + rank.

Add to city_activities:

is_popular BOOLEAN DEFAULT false

popular_rank INT NULL

Seed script reads the JSON above and for each city:

finds/creates the activity row

sets is_popular=true, popular_rank=1..12

UI query:

WHERE city_id=? AND is_popular=true ORDER BY popular_rank ASC

If you want, paste your current city_activities schema (columns) and I’ll tell you the exact minimal change (single-column vs join-table) that fits your current structure.

here is what replit did for LA The curated LA "Popular" list is now active. Updated 12 activities:

Griffith Observatory
Hollywood Sign Hike
Santa Monica Pier
Venice Beach
Getty Center
The Broad Museum
Los Angeles County Museum of Art
Universal Studios Hollywood
Grand Central Market
Hollywood Walk of Fame
TCL Chinese Theatre
Rodeo Drive
What changed:

Runyon Canyon, Dodger Stadium, Silver Lake, Echo Park → now in "AI Ideas" section (More Ideas)
Popular section only shows the curated tourist anchors
AI cannot override the Popular list - it's static per city
How it works now:

FEATURED_CITY_ACTIVITIES = curated top 12 per city (LA/NYC/London/Paris done)
Featured items get isFeatured=true, source='featured', rank=1-12
Everything else gets isFeatured=false, goes to AI Ideas section
You can refresh any city's featured list with:

POST /api/city-activities/{cityName}/refresh-featured

i think after the static list, then we have AI for more suggestions> with the ban list and with parameters so no  close overlap or issues like that

we are focusing on LA launch then SF, NYC, Austin, NOLA, MIAMI, Chicago, so those cities should be included in the static list as well
Thought for 38s

Yep — static “Popular” first, then AI “More ideas” with (1) ban list + (2) strict “must be city-specific” rules + (3) strong dedupe.

Tell Replit exactly what to do next
1) Add these lists into FEATURED_CITY_ACTIVITIES

Ensure cityName matches your DB city record exactly (ex: “San Francisco”, “New Orleans”, etc.)

Run your existing refresh endpoint for each city, or seed once.

2) AI “More ideas” rules (so it doesn’t generate junk)

In addition to your dedupe:

Ban list (your substring filter)

Must contain a proper noun (named place/neighborhood/venue). If it’s generic like “Food Hall Tastings” → reject.

Exclude anything similar to featured (normalize + similarity threshold)

Return exactly 6 (try up to 2 generations to fill after filtering)
