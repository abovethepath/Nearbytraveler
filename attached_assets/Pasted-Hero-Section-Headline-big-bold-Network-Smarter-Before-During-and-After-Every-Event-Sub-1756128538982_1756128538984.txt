Section 1: How It Works (Timeline)
🎉 Before Events

Browse profiles of fellow attendees heading to the same city/event

Break the ice with quick intros or group plans

Arrive already connected and confident

💫 During Events

Spot familiar faces instantly

Skip awkward small talk

Share updates, live moments, and create memories together

🌍 After Events

Keep your new contacts alive

Plan future meetups or trips

Instantly recognize connections at future events

Section 2: Why Networking is Broken

Side-by-side comparison

❌ Old Way

Cold introductions & random encounters

Awkward small talk

Business cards that get lost

No way to keep in touch after

✅ Nearby Traveler Way

Warm connections before the event

Shared context, stories & interests

Real friendships and professional contacts

Easy reconnection anytime, anywhere

Section 3: Real-Life Example (Story Block)

“Imagine meeting someone at a startup mixer in New York… and then bumping into them at a food festival in Barcelona months later. With Nearby Traveler, you’ll instantly recognize each other and pick up right where you left off. That’s the power of lasting connections.”

(Background: traveler recognizing a friend in a foreign city.)

Section 4: Why Professionals Love It

🎯 Better than Business Cards — real profiles with photos & stories

🤝 Pre-Networking Made Easy — walk in with warm intros

🌟 Connections That Last — friendships & business contacts beyond the event

Section 5: Social Proof / Testimonials (future-ready)

“Thanks to Nearby Traveler, I met half my conference crew before I even landed. The event felt like a reunion, not a room full of strangers.” – Alex, Startup Founder
