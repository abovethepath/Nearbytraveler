Yep — this is enough to review directionally, and both changes are the right ones. The only thing missing is the actual query/code to verify correctness/performance, but I can still give you a solid “ship/no-ship + watchouts” review.

1) Matching changes (privateInterests removed)
✅ Ship it if these are true

privateInterests is not used in:

matching queries

user cards

profile APIs

logs/analytics payloads

Only interests + customInterests drive matching.

That’s the clean Apple-safe posture.

Two things to tighten (important)

A) Custom interests can hurt match quality
Freeform tags create false negatives (“walks in nature” vs “nature walking”). If you keep customInterests in matching, do at least one of these:

Normalize on save: lowercase, trim, collapse spaces, remove punctuation

Deduplicate per user

Optionally: map custom interests into your canonical list later

B) Add/confirm GIN indexes
If you’re using Postgres overlap (&&) or containment (@>), create GIN indexes:

interests column (array)

customInterests column (array)

Otherwise matching will get slower fast.

Quick “correctness tests” you should run

empty interests/customInterests doesn’t break query

overlap works for standard interests

overlap works for customInterests after normalization

blocked users / same user not returned

ranking favors more shared interests (if you rank)

2) Pill UX changes (search + categories + expand/collapse)
✅ Ship it — this is exactly the right UX upgrade

For 100+ pills, category grouping + search is the correct pattern and will increase completion.

Two UX watchouts

A) Search + collapsed sections
Make sure typing a search term doesn’t “hide” results inside collapsed groups.
Best behavior:

when search is non-empty → auto-expand matching categories and hide others.

B) Selection persistence
Selected pills must remain selected even when filtered out and back in.

iOS double-toggle fix

touchedRecently is a legit workaround. Just make sure:

it doesn’t block legitimate fast taps

it resets on blur/unmount

My one-sentence verdict

Good changes, aligned with a matching platform’s needs.
Just don’t let customInterests quietly degrade matching—normalize it and index the arrays.

If you paste the actual matching.ts function (or just the query builder), I’ll do a real code-level sanity check for:

incorrect OR logic (common bug)

missing filters (self-match, blocked)

full table scans

ranking math and pagination correctness
