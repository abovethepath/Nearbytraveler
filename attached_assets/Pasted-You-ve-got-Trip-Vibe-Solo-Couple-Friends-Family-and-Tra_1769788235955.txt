You’ve got Trip Vibe (Solo/Couple/Friends/Family) and “Traveler Type” checkboxes repeating the same thing.

What to do (clean fix)
1) Delete these checkboxes entirely

Solo Traveler

Couple Traveler

Group Traveler

Family Traveler

Because Trip Vibe already covers them.

2) Either remove “Traveler Type” altogether OR shrink it to 3–5 optional tags

If you keep any, keep only ones that add signal without stigma:

Keep (optional):

Business Trip

Digital Nomad

First time here

Maybe (optional, but I’d skip for now):

Backpacker

Student Traveler

Solo Parent Travel / Parent seeking parent friends (only if Linkids/parent angle matters in NT)

Remove (I agree with you):

Budget Traveler

Luxury Traveler (people won’t select, and it’s awkward)

3) Rename the section so it’s not “type”

Replace “Traveler Type” with:
Optional trip tags (optional)
Helper text: “These help with recommendations. You can skip.”

4) Order on the form

Destination, dates

Trip Vibe (required or optional)

Optional trip tags (3 items max)

Create Trip → redirect to City Plans

What to tell Replit (copy/paste)

“Remove redundant Traveler Type checkboxes (Solo/Couple/Group/Family) since Trip Vibe covers them. Remove Budget/Luxury. Replace Traveler Type with ‘Optional trip tags’ and keep only: Business Trip, Digital Nomad, First time here (max 3). Keep the form minimal and aligned with the new flow (Create Trip → redirect to City Plans).”

i do ask if they ahve a hotel or a car on this page, not sure it is needed yet, we are not connecting anyone to sthese services

You don’t need “hotel” or “car” right now unless you’re using it to improve matching in a way the user will feel immediately.

Recommendation: remove from Phase 1

Accommodation type

Transportation method

They add friction, and you’re not delivering value off them yet (no booking, no deals, no logistics features).

If you want to keep something without friction

Make it optional later (after trip is created), or tuck it behind “More details (optional)”.

Best approach:

Trip create page = Destination + dates + Trip vibe

After redirect to City Plans, add a small “Trip details” link:
“Add hotel/transport details (optional)”

What to tell Replit (copy/paste)

“Remove Accommodation and Transportation from the main trip creation form for now (not used for matching or services yet). Keep the trip create flow minimal: destination, dates, trip vibe (optional tags). Add accommodation/transport as optional ‘Trip details’ editable later in the trip plan page.”
