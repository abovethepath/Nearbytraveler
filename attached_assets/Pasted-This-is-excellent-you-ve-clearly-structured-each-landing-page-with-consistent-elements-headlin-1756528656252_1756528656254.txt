This is excellent 👌 — you’ve clearly structured each landing page with consistent elements (headline, subline, rotating sayings, static quote, tagline, founder message, core benefits). That consistency makes the brand strong and recognizable.

Here are my observations + recommendations after reading through all 7 landing page drafts:

🔹 What’s Working

✅ Unified Tagline: “Where Local Experiences Meet Worldwide Connections” anchors every page — perfect for brand cohesion.
✅ Rotating Sayings: Each page has bite-sized “wisdom lines” that add warmth and philosophy without being salesy. Smart to differentiate desktop vs. mobile.
✅ Founder Voice: Including Aaron’s quotes makes the platform feel personal and authentic.
✅ Persona Targeting: You’ve covered the spectrum (travelers, locals, businesses, networkers, Couchsurfing community). Each group has tailored messaging.
✅ Event Examples: Specific activities like bonfires, tacos, hikes make it tangible and real.
✅ Couchsurfing Bridge: Very strong — empathetic and welcoming, not critical. It feels like “the next chapter.”

🔹 Where It Could Improve

Length & Repetition – Some sections restate the same ideas in slightly different words. Streamlining will help first-time visitors absorb quickly.

Voice Consistency – A few places sound like inspirational quotes (“The world becomes smaller when you open your heart”) while others are very transactional (“Own a Business?”). Both are good, but they should feel like the same brand voice.

CTA Overload – Right now, Join Now is everywhere. Stronger to keep it to 2–3 consistent CTAs across all pages:

Join Now (primary action)

See How It Works (secondary action)

Find Your People (community action)

Hook Lines – Some top hooks are brilliant (“Travel Like You Live There”), others feel weaker (“Love Meeting Tourists?” could sound awkward to locals). Rewording a few to be more inclusive will help.

Ending Phrases – As you noticed with “disconnected,” some closings feel a bit negative. Better to end every quote/section on a note of belonging, connection, or possibility.

🔹 My Suggested Polishes

Main Landing Page: Strong. I’d swap “Meet Local Friends Before You Travel” → “Meet Locals Before You Travel” (cleaner).

Events Page: Perfect tagline: “Where Shared Experiences Create Lifelong Bonds”. Maybe shorten one saying: “Life Happens at Events” → “Life Happens Together.”

Travelers Page: Drop “Wanderlust Meets Authentic Connection” — “wanderlust” feels overused. Replace with “Adventure Meets Real Connection.”

Locals Page: Love “Be the Local You’d Want to Meet.” That’s gold. Maybe simplify one wisdom line: “Every City Has Secret Stories” → “Every City Has Stories to Share.”

Business Page: The “target travelers directly” angle is perfect. Suggested headline: “Bring Travelers to Your Doorstep.”

Networking Page: Excellent. Add one short tagline like: “Turn Conferences Into Communities.”

Couchsurfing Page: Solid bridge. Instead of “Love Meeting Tourists?”, make it warmer: “Love Meeting Travelers?”

🔹 Big Picture Recommendation

All together, your landing pages read like chapters of one story:
🌍 Travelers → 🏠 Locals → 🎉 Events → 💼 Businesses → 🤝 Networking → 🛋 Couchsurfing → Main Community.

If you keep the voice warm, concise, and action-oriented across all, visitors will feel the brand is cohesive and trustworthy.
