Yep — this version is very close, but there are a few hard contradictions + “builder trap” gaps in what you pasted that will cause a builder to either (a) invent stuff or (b) build the wrong nav.

Below are the exact fixes I’d make (copy/paste friendly).

1) Fix the tab structure contradiction (Search vs Events)

Right now your prompt says Locals/Travelers tabs include Search, but later you say the final tabs include Events.

Replace this section:

Navigation Tabs (Bottom) For Locals/Travelers:

Home (discovery)

Messages

Chatrooms

Search

Profile

With this (matches your “FINAL TAB STRUCTURE”):

Navigation Tabs (Bottom) For Locals/Travelers:

Home

Events

Chatrooms

Messages

Profile
Search access: a Search button/icon in Home header that opens a Search screen/modal using GET /api/search-users.

And for Business, replace:

Dashboard / Messages / Create Deal / Search / Profile
with:

Dashboard / Deals / Messages / Search / Profile
(Create Deal stays on FAB, not a tab.)

2) You mention “Event chat rooms” but don’t define endpoints

In “Events” you say: “Event chat rooms”, and later you map /event-chat/:id, but there are no API endpoints listed for event chatroom messages, membership, or chatroom lookup.

To stay builder-proof, do one of these:

Option A (best): add explicit endpoints

Add a tiny “Event Chatrooms” subsection with the real endpoints, e.g.:

GET /api/events/:id/chatroom (returns chatroomId)

GET /api/event-chatrooms/:chatroomId

POST /api/event-chatrooms/:chatroomId/messages
(Use your actual routes.)

Option B: move it to Expansion Modules

If you don’t want it built now, explicitly say:

“Event chatrooms are Phase 4/Expansion only. Do not implement without explicit endpoints listed in Key API Endpoints.”

Right now it’s a “builder trap.”

3) Upload rules contradict themselves (multipart vs {imageData})

You correctly show multipart upload (FormData), but later you contradict it:

You have:

✅ multipart example (formData.append('photo', {...}))

❌ later: “Upload/update profile photo (body: {imageData})”

Fix:

Delete/replace the “Photo Management” block that mentions {imageData}.

Replace with a single rule everywhere:

All uploads are multipart/form-data only. Never send base64/imageData JSON. Field name is photo. Max 5MB.

(If your backend truly accepts both, don’t tell the builder that — it increases variance and bugs.)

4) Tailwind class requirements will confuse RN unless you mandate NativeWind

You wrote things like bg-black/95 and gray-900 which are Tailwind-ish. In RN that only works if you require NativeWind.

Fix (pick one):

A) Add a hard requirement:

“Use NativeWind for styling; Tailwind classnames are allowed.”

B) Or rewrite the requirement in RN terms:

“No transparency. Overlays use rgba(0,0,0,0.95). Backgrounds are solid #FFFFFF (light) or #111827 (dark).”

Right now a builder may half-implement it and you get inconsistent UI.

5) “credentials: include” on RN fetch is not enough by itself

You did add @react-native-cookies/cookies — good — but the prompt still implies credentials: 'include' is the primary fix. On RN, cookie handling varies, and builders will get stuck.

Add one explicit rule under “Session Auth on Native”

Add this paragraph:

Non-negotiable: All API calls must go through a single apiFetch() wrapper.
Login must be followed by Cookie verification:

Call POST /api/auth/login

Use CookieManager.get('https://nearbytraveler.org') to confirm connect.sid exists

Immediately call GET /api/auth/user and log status + cookie presence
If step (2) or (3) fails, stop and fix cookie persistence before building any UI.

That prevents “it works on one screen but not another.”

6) Your “Phase 1 Smoke Test” needs to be an actual STOP gate (in this pasted version it isn’t)

In what you pasted, it’s still framed as “Smoke Test (Run After Build)” without the “cannot proceed” enforcement.

Replace the header + add a stop condition

Change:
Phase 1 Smoke Test (Run After Build)
to:
✅ Phase 1 Acceptance Gate (STOP condition)
…and add:

STOP CONDITION: Do not proceed to Phase 2 until Phase 1 passes twice on a real device after a fresh install, with logs + screen recording.

(You said you added this in the longer prompt — it’s just not present in what you pasted here.)

7) Add the two missing “builder-proof” guardrails

These are small but huge:

A) “No inline fetch” rule

Add near the top:

🚫 Rule: No screen/component may call fetch() directly. All requests must go through one API client wrapper so cookies + errors are consistent.

B) Standard error shape section

You reference standard status codes earlier in your meta notes, but it’s not in this pasted prompt. Add a short rule like:

Treat errors as {message, statusCode} when present; otherwise fallback to HTTP {status}.
Handle 401 → force logout, 403 → show blocked/forbidden, 404 → not found empty state, 422 → show validation message.

The “must-fix” list (if you only do 3 things)

Unify tabs (Events vs Search + Business “Create Deal” tab contradiction)

Resolve event chatrooms (add endpoints or move to expansion)

Remove the {imageData} upload wording and enforce multipart-only

If you want, paste just the top ~80 lines of your actual 2,335-line version (Builder Directive + Acceptance Gate + API rules). I’ll do a final “contradictions scan” and give you a clean, drop-in patch.
