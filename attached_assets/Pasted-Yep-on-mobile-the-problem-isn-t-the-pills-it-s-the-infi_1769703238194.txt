Yep — on mobile, the problem isn’t the pills, it’s the infinite scroll. Fix it without adding “new pages” by using one-page + section switching.

Best mobile solution: one page, but only ONE section visible at a time

Add a sticky “section switcher” at the top (not tabs to new pages—just filters on the same page):

[ Popular ] [ AI Ideas ] [ Preferences ] [ Selected ]

When you tap one, the page either:

filters to show only that section, OR

smooth-scrolls to that section and collapses the others.

This kills the endless scroll while staying “one screen.”

What Replit should implement (copy/paste)
1) Sticky section switcher (mobile only)

On screens < 768px, render a sticky bar under the title:

Buttons: Popular, AI Ideas, Preferences, Selected

Behavior option A (best): show-only mode

Default view = Popular

Tapping changes visible section; other sections hidden

Add a small “Show All” link for power users

2) Progressive reveal for each section

Popular: show 8–12 (no “all” by default)

AI Ideas: show last 6–18 (3 batches max visible), older batches collapse automatically

Preferences: show 10, with “Show 10 more”

3) Floating “Selected” button

Bottom-right floating button:

Selected (5)
Opens a bottom sheet with selected items + Clear + Done.
This prevents users from scrolling down just to see what they picked.

4) Optional (super useful): “Search within this city”

Search filters the currently visible section only (so it doesn’t feel like searching a massive page).

Alternative if you hate hide/show

Instead of hide/show mode, do Jump + auto-collapse:

Tap “AI Ideas” → scroll to AI section and collapse Popular + Preferences

Tap “Preferences” → scroll down and collapse the rest
Same effect: no endless scroll.

Quick win even before coding any of that

On mobile, set the City Picks page to open scrolled to Popular and keep Universal collapsed by default (with “Show Universal Preferences”).

If you want, tell me which behavior you prefer:

Show-only mode (cleanest on phone)

Jump + auto-collapse (feels like “one page” but not endless)

Either way, it fixes the long-scroll problem without adding “more tabs/pages.”
