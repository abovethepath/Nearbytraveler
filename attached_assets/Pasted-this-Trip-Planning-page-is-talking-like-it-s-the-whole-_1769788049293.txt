this Trip Planning page is talking like it’s the whole matching engine, but in your new flow it’s really just Step 1: set destination + dates, then Step 2: City Plans is where matching intent gets specific. So the page copy + fields need to match that reality.

What to change (simple, high-impact)
1) Fix the promise + redirect (most important)

After “Create My Trip Plan” succeeds:

Auto-redirect to: City Plans for {Destination}

Show a toast/banner:
“Trip created! Next: choose 3–8 City Plans to match faster.”
Button: “Go to City Plans →”

On the page itself (above the form):
Replace the “fill out as detailed as possible…” with:

Step 1 of 2: Create your trip
Destination + dates get you into the right city.
Next, you’ll pick City Plans (things you want to do) to match with the right people.

2) Reduce “Traveler Type” clutter

That big checklist is too much friction and includes stuff people won’t self-label (budget/luxury).

Replace it with 2–4 lightweight inputs:

Required

Destination (city)

Dates

Optional (keep it simple)

Who are you traveling with? (Solo / Couple / Friends / Family) (you already have this)

What are you looking for? (Meet locals / Meet travelers / Both) (super helpful for matching)

Trip pace (Chill / Balanced / Packed) (harmless + useful)

Everything else can be moved to City Plans or Profile later.

3) Reframe “budget/luxury” as non-judgmental

If you still want that signal, don’t ask “Budget Traveler.”

Use:

Spending comfort: Value-focused / Mid-range / Treat-yourself
or

Typical plans: Free/cheap activities / A mix / Premium experiences

Make it optional and don’t surface it loudly.

4) Make City Plans the “matching” step

Under the submit button (or in a right-side panel on desktop), add a preview:

Next: City Plans (2 minutes)

Pick 3–8 things you want to do in {City}

We’ll use those to show your best matches

You can edit anytime

5) Rename the page/title for clarity

Your header “Plan Your Next Adventure” is fine marketing, but the functional page title should be:

Create a Trip
Subheader:

“Destination + dates. Then choose City Plans.”

What to tell Replit (copy/paste)

“Update Trip Planning to reflect the new flow: it’s Step 1 (destination+dates) and City Plans is Step 2 (activities for matching). Remove the ‘fill out as detailed as possible’ language. After successful trip creation, redirect to /city-plans/:city and show ‘Trip created! Next: pick 3–8 City Plans to match faster.’ Simplify Traveler Type checklist to: required destination+dates; optional ‘traveling with’ (solo/couple/friends/family), ‘looking to meet’ (locals/travelers/both), and ‘trip pace’ (chill/balanced/packed). Replace budget/luxury labels with optional neutral ‘Value-focused / Mid-range / Treat-yourself’.”

If you want, I can also give you the exact replacement copy for the top paragraph + the submit button area so it reads clean and confident.
