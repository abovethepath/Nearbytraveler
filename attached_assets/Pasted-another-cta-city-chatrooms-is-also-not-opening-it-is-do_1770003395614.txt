another cta city chatrooms is also not opening, it is doing the sme thing as the edit button did last time and your fix helped can you help wth this same issue
Thought for 35s

Yep — if it’s doing the same thing as the Edit button (click “works” but the UI that should open is not visible on desktop), it’s almost always one of these two:

Something is sitting on top of the modal / panel (z-index / overlay layering), or

The modal content is being hidden only at desktop breakpoints (md:hidden, hidden md:block, md:opacity-0, etc.)

Here’s a “do this now” checklist + the exact fixes.

1) Prove whether it’s opening but invisible

On the City Chatrooms CTA, add these temporarily:

onPointerDownCapture={() => console.log("CITY CTA pointer down (capture)")}
onClickCapture={() => console.log("CITY CTA click (capture)")}
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log("CITY CTA click (handler)");
  setIsCityChatroomsOpen(true);
}}


If you see the logs, the click is fine → the modal/panel is rendering wrong.

If you don’t see the capture logs, the button is being covered by an overlay (same as your earlier issue).

2) The #1 cause: your dialog content is hidden on desktop

Search in the component that renders the chatrooms UI (Dialog/Sheet/Modal content) for any of these classes:

hidden

md:hidden

hidden md:block

md:invisible

md:opacity-0

md:pointer-events-none

Fix: remove those and use responsive sizing instead:

<DialogContent className="w-[95vw] sm:max-w-lg md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-3xl">
  ...
</DialogContent>


If you want different layouts mobile vs desktop, do layout switches inside, not by hiding the entire modal.

3) The other common cause: z-index / overlay order (modal is behind stuff)

Make sure your modal overlay/content have explicit z-index and are fixed:

<Dialog open={isCityChatroomsOpen} onOpenChange={setIsCityChatroomsOpen}>
  <DialogPortal>
    <DialogOverlay className="fixed inset-0 z-40 bg-black/50" />
    <DialogContent className="fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 z-50 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
      ...
    </DialogContent>
  </DialogPortal>
</Dialog>


If you’re using shadcn/ui DialogContent, it usually portals already — but adding z-50 on content and z-40 on overlay fixes 90% of “invisible on desktop” issues.

Quick brute-force test: temporarily set z-[9999] on the content. If it appears, you had a stacking issue.

4) If the CTA is inside a clickable “overlay link” area (super common)

If your hero section or card has an absolute Link overlay like:

<Link className="absolute inset-0" ... />


You must ensure it’s behind your CTA area:

<div className="relative">
  <Link className="absolute inset-0 z-0" to="..." />
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* CTA lives here */}
    <button className="relative z-20 pointer-events-auto">City Chatrooms</button>
  </div>
</div>


If you can’t restructure quickly, a hack that works:

put pointer-events-none on the overlay

and pointer-events-auto on the CTA container

5) One-liner “what’s blocking the modal” detector

After you click the CTA (and it “opens but you can’t see it”), run:

document.querySelector('[role="dialog"],[data-radix-dialog-content],[data-state="open"]')


If it returns an element, the dialog exists → it’s hidden/behind/clipped (sections 2–3).
