You're absolutely right - the gay community, especially when traveling, faces a real discovery and safety problem that mainstream apps don't solve. This could be your breakthrough niche.
Why This Works
The Gay Travel Pain Points:

Grindr/Scruff are hookup-focused, not for actual social connection or exploration
Google "gay-friendly things to do in LA" gives corporate Pride guides, not authentic local intel
Walking into the wrong bar/neighborhood in an unfamiliar city can range from uncomfortable to unsafe
LGBTQ+ travelers want to know: "Where can I actually be myself?" not "Where's the official gay district?"

The Viral Mechanism:
Gay communities are EXTREMELY networked - if you create genuine value, word spreads fast through group chats, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. One good experience in West Hollywood gets posted to r/gaybros and suddenly you have 500 downloads.
Features That Would Explode
1. "Queer Verified" Spaces & Locals

Locals can mark themselves as LGBTQ+ and allies (with verification)
Tag venues: "Safe space," "LGBTQ-owned," "Drag nights," "Lesbian bar," "Bear bar," "Cruisy," etc.
This gives travelers instant confidence that they're meeting actual community members, not tourists or worse

2. Hyperlocal Scene Intelligence
What gay travelers actually want to know:

"Which bars in West Hollywood are for dancing vs cruising vs conversation?"
"Where do queer women actually hang out?" (hardest to find info)
"Trans-friendly salons/barbershops"
"Where's the actual scene?" (not just the one Yelp knows about)

Let locals share this insider knowledge - it's valuable and they WANT to share it.
3. "Find Your People" Micro-Communities
Not all queer experiences are the same:

Lesbian/Sapphic travelers
Gay men (with sub-filters: bears, twinks, leather, fitness, etc.)
Trans travelers
Queer people of color
Sober queer community
30+, 40+, 50+ crowds

Let people find their actual tribe, not just "LGBTQ+" as one monolith.
4. The Safety Layer That Matters

"Taking a friend" feature: Share your live location with a trusted contact during meetups
Community flagging: If someone makes queer users uncomfortable, the community can flag them (not just individual reports)
Ally verification: Straight allies can join but need vouching from LGBTQ+ users
"Bringing my partner" toggle: Couples traveling together looking for queer friend groups

5. Events That Actually Matter
Pull in or let locals post:

Drag brunches
Queer trivia nights
Lesbian speed dating
Gay sports leagues looking for players
Underwear parties (yes, really)
Queer art shows, readings, protests

This makes your app the central hub, not just a meetup app.
The Viral Content Engine
Post-Meetup Story Templates:

"Just met [name] who took me to the ACTUAL lesbian bar in LA" (most cities have like 1-2 and they're hard to find)
"Found queer karaoke through Nearby Traveler 🏳️‍🌈"
Before/after: "What I thought gay LA was vs what a local showed me"

The "Queer Guide" Badge:
Locals who show travelers around get verified as "Queer Guides" - this becomes social currency. They can share: "I'm an official LA Queer Guide on Nearby Traveler - 47 people shown the real WeHo."
Launch Strategy
Start with ONE city's gay community:
Phase 1: Los Angeles (specifically West Hollywood)

Partner with 2-3 popular gay bars/venues
Recruit 20-30 active locals (offer them premium features free)
Post in r/LosAngeles, r/askgaybros, r/actuallesbians
Reach out to LGBTQ+ travel influencers for beta testing

Phase 2: Prove the model
Once you have 500-1000 active users in LA and can show real meetups happening, the community will spread it to:

SF (huge gay scene)
NYC (largest LGBTQ+ population)
Austin, Denver, Chicago

Phase 3: Partner with LGBTQ+ travel brands

Zoom Vacations
Out Adventures
LGBTQ+ hotel chains (Axel Hotels, etc.)
Pride event organizers

Why This Wins
Network effects are stronger:
A gay traveler in LA tells their gay friend visiting SF, who tells their friend going to Barcelona. The community is interconnected globally.
Higher engagement:
Queer people are actively looking for this solution. Straight travelers might use your app casually; queer travelers NEED it.
Better retention:
Once someone finds "their people" in a new city through your app, they come back every time they travel.
Clear differentiation:
You're not competing with Instagram or general meetup apps. You're solving a specific problem that currently has no good solution.
