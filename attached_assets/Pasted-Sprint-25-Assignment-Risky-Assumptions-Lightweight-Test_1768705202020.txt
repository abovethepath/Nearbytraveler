Sprint 25 Assignment — Risky Assumptions + Lightweight Test (Nearby Traveler)
1) Risky assumption categories (for my business type)

Nearby Traveler is a two-sided community/marketplace (locals + travelers) with events, messaging, and calendar planning. The solution-side risky assumption categories I’m using are:

Technical feasibility

Workflow/UX feasibility

Coordination feasibility

Trust & safety feasibility

Data/integration feasibility (events/calendar)

2) Five solution-side risky assumptions (with heatmap scoring)
1) Trust & safety is feasible at MVP level

Importance: 10

Uncertainty: 8

Risk factor: 80

Assumption: We can ship a baseline safety system (block/report, verification-lite, meetup safety prompts, and a simple moderation workflow) that users accept and that doesn’t prevent launch.

2) Mobile/PWA usability is good enough pre-app-store

Importance: 7

Uncertainty: 7

Risk factor: 49

Assumption: Users can complete core flows (onboarding → matches → message → event plan) on their phone without serious friction.

3) Super Calendar feasibility

Importance: 8

Uncertainty: 7

Risk factor: 56

Assumption: We can reliably combine user-created events + curated links + at least one external source (Meetup/Eventbrite/ICS) into one usable calendar without duplicates/confusion.

4) Dual-identity onboarding works (“everyone starts as a Local”)

Importance: 8

Uncertainty: 6

Risk factor: 48

Assumption: Users understand the Local-first model, finish setup, and don’t bounce due to confusion.

5) Matching quality is feasible without “real AI”

Importance: 7

Uncertainty: 6

Risk factor: 42

Assumption: Simple rules (interests + dates + location radius + vibe tags) produce matches people actually want to message.

3) Lightweight test design (run this sprint)
Test name

5-person Mobile Flow + Trust & Safety Scenario Test

Goal

Increase confidence that Nearby Traveler is feasible to use on mobile and feasible to launch safely (trust/safety expectations), while also validating that onboarding and matching feel clear and relevant.

Primary assumption tested

Trust & safety feasibility (Risk factor 80)

Secondary assumptions tested

Mobile/PWA usability, Local-first onboarding clarity, matching relevance, calendar usefulness

Participants

5 potential users, recruited from my network/community (mix of locals + travelers or travel-curious users).

Method (15 minutes per participant)

Mobile core flow (6–8 minutes): On their phone, participant completes:

open Nearby Traveler → sign up/log in

explain “Why do I start as a Local?” in one sentence

view matches/people → pick 1 person they would message → send a message

add/save 1 event to the calendar (either user-created or from a curated/external link)
Note: QR code scanning is in progress and is excluded from this sprint test.

Safety scenarios (5 minutes): Ask what they expect the platform to do in these situations:

receiving a creepy/harassing message

suspecting a fake profile/catfish

meetup safety/no-show

Rating + key insight (2 minutes):

“Would you meet someone through this platform?” (1–5)

“What single safety feature is a MUST before you’d use it?”

Data captured

Completed flow (Y/N)

Time to complete (minutes)

Understood “Local-first” (Y/N)

Match relevance rating (1–5)

Willingness-to-meet rating (1–5)

Top “must-have” safety features (short list)

1–2 direct user quotes

Biggest friction point on mobile (one line)

Success criteria

4/5 complete the mobile core flow without help (or I identify the exact friction points)

4/5 correctly explain the Local-first concept

Average ≥ 4/5 relevance rating for at least one match/person they viewed

Top 3 safety “must-haves” repeat across interviews

Average ≥ 4/5 “safe enough to meet” rating assuming must-have safety items are implemented

Decision rule

If users complete the flow and safety expectations are achievable for an MVP, I will persevere and prioritize implementing the top safety requirements.

If users require heavy verification/security beyond an MVP, I will adjust scope and strengthen guardrails before encouraging meetups.

4) New contact to build confidence in feasibility
New contact

Trust & Safety / marketplace community safety expert (or experienced community moderator).

Purpose

Validate my MVP safety checklist and identify “must-have before launch” requirements.

Outreach message used

“Hey [Name] — I’m building Nearby Traveler (locals + travelers meet around shared interests/events). For a sprint assignment I’m validating solution feasibility and would love a quick 15–20 min gut-check on MVP trust/safety must-haves (report/block, verification-lite, meetup safety flows). Are you open this week?”

What I will document from the conversation

Who they are (name, title/company)

3 key recommendations

The single most important change I should make before launch

5) Updating my solution-side risky assumptions (after the test)

After running the 5 interviews, I will update each assumption with:

Result: metrics + 1 quote

Confidence change: (e.g., Uncertainty 8 → 6)

Decision: Persevere / Adjust / Pause

Next step: specific product change

If you want, paste your notes after you do the 5 conversations and I’ll turn them into a clean “Results” section and updated uncertainty scores so your PDF looks complete.

i dont have time for the 5 conversarions, can we make them up here
Thought for 15s

I can’t help you make up the 5 conversations or fabricate results for homework. That would be dishonest and could get you in trouble if your professor checks.

What I can do (and what will still let you submit a PDF) is one of these fast, legit options:

Option A (best): Convert it to a “designed test + in-progress results”

If you truly can’t run interviews, you can submit:

the 5 risky assumptions + heatmap (you already have)

the test design

the new contact outreach

a clearly labeled “Next step: run interviews” section

This is honest, but it may not fully satisfy “run” depending on your rubric.

Option B (fast + still real): Do 5 “micro-conversations” by text

A “conversation” can be a DM/text exchange. Send one message to 5 people and collect quick replies.

Copy/paste message to send to 5 people (WhatsApp/IG/LinkedIn/SMS)

Quick favor — I’m testing a travel app concept where locals + travelers meet around shared interests/events.

On a scale of 1–5, would you meet someone through a platform like this?

What’s the #1 safety feature you’d need to feel comfortable?

If you saw 5 matched people + a shared events calendar, would you use it? (Y/N + why)

When they reply, that counts as a lightweight test + evidence.

Option C: Use your existing feedback as 2 of the 5 (truthfully)

You already have real landing page feedback from:

Juliane (tester)

Armondo (Couchsurfing ambassador)

Those can be logged as 2 “customer conversations” if you document them as prior interviews/feedback — then you only need 3 more quick DM replies (Option B).

Here’s a Word-ready section you can paste RIGHT NOW (honest + ready), with a spot to drop real replies
Sprint 25 — Lightweight Test Results (Micro-Conversation Method)

Method: I ran lightweight “micro-conversations” by text (DM/SMS) using a 3-question script to validate feasibility quickly. I also included two prior documented feedback conversations from existing testers/community members.

Questions asked:

Would you meet someone through a platform like this? (1–5)

What’s the #1 safety feature required?

Would you use matches + an events calendar for planning? (Y/N + why)

Responses summary (n=5):

Avg willingness-to-meet score (1–5): [__]

Most common safety must-have: [__]

% who said they’d use matches + calendar: [__]%

Top friction/concern mentioned: [__]

Raw response log (copy/paste or summarize):

R1 (source: [DM/SMS], Local/Traveler: []): willingness []/5; must-have safety: []; use matches+calendar: [Y/N], why: “[]”

R2: …

R3: …

R4: …

R5: …

Decision / next step: Based on the most common safety requirements, I will prioritize:

[__]

[__]

[__]
Then I will re-test willingness-to-meet after these are implemented.

If you paste any 3–5 replies you get (even short ones), I’ll:

turn them into clean “results” language for your PDF,

update your uncertainty scores honestly (e.g., 8 → 6),

and write the “decision + next steps” section so it matches your 5 assumptions.

ok i can ask those 3 questions

Perfect. Here’s exactly what to copy/paste and send, plus what to paste into your Word/PDF afterward.

1) Copy/paste message to send (send to 5 people)

Short version (best for SMS/WhatsApp):

Quick favor — I’m testing Nearby Traveler (locals + travelers meet around shared interests + events).

On a scale of 1–5, would you meet someone through a platform like this?

What’s the #1 safety feature you’d need to feel comfortable?

If you saw matched people + a shared events calendar, would you use it? (Y/N + why)

Slightly more context (if they ask “what is it?”):

Nearby Traveler connects travelers visiting a city with locals who share interests, so they can meet for activities/events. I’m validating feasibility and safety expectations.

2) Paste this into Word now (your “Lightweight Test” section)

(Then you’ll fill in the blanks once replies come in.)

Lightweight Test — Micro-Conversation Survey (DM/SMS)

Goal: Validate feasibility quickly: (1) willingness to meet, (2) minimum safety requirements, (3) usefulness of matches + calendar.

Method: I sent a 3-question message to 5 potential users via DM/SMS and collected short responses.

Questions:

Would you meet someone through a platform like this? (1–5)

What’s the #1 safety feature you’d need to feel comfortable?

Would you use matched people + a shared events calendar for planning? (Y/N + why)

Success criteria:

Average willingness-to-meet score ≥ 4/5 (or clear segment-level insight)

At least 3/5 say “Yes” to using matches + calendar

Clear top 2–3 “must-have” safety features emerge

Results summary (n=5):

Average willingness-to-meet score: [ ] / 5

% who would use matches + calendar: [ ]%

Top safety must-haves (most common themes): 1) [ ] 2) [ ] 3) [ ]

Biggest concern/friction mentioned: [ ]

Raw response log (brief):

R1: willingness [ ]/5; must-have safety: [ ]; matches+calendar: [Y/N]; why: “[ ]”

R2: willingness [ ]/5; must-have safety: [ ]; matches+calendar: [Y/N]; why: “[ ]”

R3: willingness [ ]/5; must-have safety: [ ]; matches+calendar: [Y/N]; why: “[ ]”

R4: willingness [ ]/5; must-have safety: [ ]; matches+calendar: [Y/N]; why: “[ ]”

R5: willingness [ ]/5; must-have safety: [ ]; matches+calendar: [Y/N]; why: “[ ]”

Decision / next step: Based on responses, I will prioritize implementing:

[ ]

[ ]

[ ]
Then re-test willingness-to-meet after these are in place.
