Most likely a higher‑z, full‑width overlay (often an absolutely positioned div in the hero) is sitting on top of this CTA container and capturing pointer events, so z-index on the buttons alone does nothing.

What to check in the layout
Inspect in devtools

In Chrome devtools, hover the CTAs in the Elements panel and look for any parent or sibling element that visually overlays that area when highlighted (often a ::before gradient, a cover image, or a full-width div).

In the “Event Listeners” / “Computed” panel, verify which element is actually receiving click events (you can temporarily set pointer-events: none on suspect elements in devtools to see when buttons become clickable).

Common culprits in hero sections
Look for something like:

A gradient overlay:

tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b ... pointer-events-none" />
If it exists but is missing pointer-events-none, it will block clicks.

A large cover image or background wrapper with position: absolute and a high z-index.

An invisible modal/backdrop that remained mounted with pointer-events: auto and high z-index.

Why z-index on the buttons doesn’t fix it
z-index only works within the same stacking context.

If an ancestor of the overlay (e.g. the hero wrapper) has position plus a z-index, that can create a stacking context above the CTA container, even if the buttons themselves have zIndex: 9999.

So if you have something like:

tsx
<div className="relative z-50">   // overlay container
  <div className="absolute inset-0 ..."></div> // overlay
</div>

<div className="relative z-20">   // profile hero content
  {/* your CTA wrapper here */}
</div>
The overlay container (z-50) will still sit above your z-20 CTA wrapper, regardless of zIndex on the inner buttons.

Concrete fixes to try
Pick the one that matches what you find in devtools:

Make the overlay ignore pointer events
If there is a gradient or image overlay sitting on top, give it:

tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/60 to-transparent pointer-events-none" />
or inline:

tsx
style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}
This is often the cleanest fix for background-only layers.

Lower or remove its z-index
If the overlay must stay interactive in some places but not over the CTAs, reduce its z-index below the CTA wrapper or move it earlier in the DOM with a lower z-index, e.g.:

tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 z-0 ..."></div>

<div className="relative z-10">
  {/* hero content + CTAs */}
</div>
Raise the CTA container’s stacking context above the overlay
Instead of putting huge z-index on individual buttons, move it to the wrapper and ensure that wrapper’s ancestor is not in a lower stacking context:

tsx
{/* Hero content container */}
<section className="relative z-30">
  {/* CTAs — wrap on mobile */}
  {!isOwnProfile && (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3 flex-wrap min-w-0 relative z-40">
      {/* buttons as you have them now, but you can remove inline zIndex */}
    </div>
  )}
</section>
Then make sure any overlay container uses a lower z-index (e.g. z-10 or z-20).

Remove stray invisible overlays
Check for things like leftover modal backdrops:

tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-50" />  // maybe still mounted
If present, confirm their mount/unmount conditions or explicitly hide them when the profile page is active.

Minimal debugging snippet
As a quick test, temporarily add this to your CTA wrapper:

tsx
<div
  className="flex items-center gap-3 flex-wrap min-w-0 relative"
  style={{ zIndex: 999999, position: 'relative' }}
>
  ...
</div>
If the buttons are still not clickable, you almost certainly have a separate stacking context above this entire hero section (e.g., a fixed or absolute overlay at the app root). Track that down and either set pointer-events: none on it or lower its z-index relative to the hero.

If you paste the JSX for the hero wrapper and any gradient/overlay elements around this section, I can point to the exact line to change.
