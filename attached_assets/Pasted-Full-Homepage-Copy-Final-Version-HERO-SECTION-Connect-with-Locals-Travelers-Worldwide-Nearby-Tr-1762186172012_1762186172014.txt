RECONNECT ACROSS CITIES
Remember that person you met in Barcelona? They just landed in your city.
The traveler you hosted last year? They're in Tokyo—where you're heading next week.
Nearby Traveler notifies you when friends from past travels are nearby. Turn one-time encounters into lifelong connections that span the globe.
One coffee in Paris becomes dinner in New York. A hiking buddy in Bali reconnects with you in Berlin. Your travel friendships don't end when the trip does—they follow you around the world.
