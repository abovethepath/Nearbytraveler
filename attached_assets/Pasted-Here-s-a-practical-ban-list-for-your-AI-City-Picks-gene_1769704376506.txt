Here’s a practical ban list for your AI City Picks generator so it stops outputting generic “intent” pills and only produces real city-specific places/experiences.

Two rules that make this ban list work (important)
Rule 1: Require “specificity”

Only accept AI items that look like a named place/neighborhood/venue:

Contains a proper noun pattern (at least 2 words with Title Case), OR

Contains a known place type with a name (“X Park”, “Y Beach”, “Z Market”, “A Museum”)

Rule 2: Museum/Gallery exception

Don’t blanket-ban “museum/gallery” if it’s clearly a real name:
✅ “Museum of Contemporary Art” / “The Broad Museum” / “Getty Center”
❌ “Museums & Galleries” / “Art Galleries”

Implementation shortcut: allow “museum/gallery” only if the string has 2+ Title Case words or starts with “The”.

If you want the cleanest solution (even better than a ban list)

Tell the AI: “Return only items that include a specific proper name (landmark, venue, neighborhood). If it’s generic, don’t include it.”
Then still run the ban filter as a safety net.

If you paste your existing isSimilarToUniversal() / normalize code, I can format this ban list exactly as a JS array + a single shouldBan(name) function that drops right into your server route.

the issue is where is a user who is traveling to a city going to let people know they want to go biking, jogging, to gyms, to the beach, on a ghost tour? where can a user add this
Thought for 20s

They add that stuff in Universal Match Preferences — that’s exactly what that section is for.

So:

Biking → Biking / Cycling (universal)

Jogging / gym / workouts → Fitness / Workouts (universal)

Beach → Beach / Waterfront (universal)

Ghost tour → should live under Guided Tours (universal) or as its own universal chip Ghost Tours (I’d add it as an optional universal chip if you want it explicit).

Why we “ban list” those from AI

Because AI city picks should be named, city-specific (places/venues/neighborhoods), not generic intents. Users still express generic intents via the universal section.

Two quick UX fixes so mobile users don’t miss universals

Add a button near the top: “Jump to Match Preferences” (scrolls to the universal section).

Add a search bar that searches BOTH city picks + universal so someone can type “gym” or “bike” and instantly toggle it without scrolling.

How ghost tours should work (cleanest)

User selects Guided Tours (universal) and optionally Ghost Tours (universal optional).

AI can still generate specific ghost options like:

“Old Town Ghost Walk (Prague)”

“Hollywood Forever Cemetery Tour (LA)”
Those are city-specific and not generic.

If you want, I’ll give you the exact updated universal list with Ghost Tours added (and what to remove to keep it at 20).
