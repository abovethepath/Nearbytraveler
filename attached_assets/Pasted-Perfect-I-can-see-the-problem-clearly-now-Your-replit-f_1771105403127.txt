Perfect! I can see the problem clearly now. Your .replit file has two conflicting port configurations and two overlapping workflows:
The Root Issues:

Port conflict in [env]:

PORT = "3000" (top level)
PORT = "5000" (in [userenv.shared])
Your app doesn't know which port to use!


Two workflows trying to run:

"Project" workflow calls "Start application"
"Start Clean" also runs and tries to start npm run dev on port 5000
They race for the same port


"Start Clean" is unnecessary — it's just killing processes and restarting. You don't need it.

The Fix (Remove These Sections):
Delete the entire [[workflows.workflow]] block for "Start Clean" (everything from line with name = "Start Clean" through the end of that workflow section).
Also, remove the conflicting PORT in [userenv.shared] — delete this line:
PORT = "5000"
Your fixed .replit should look like this:
modules = ["nodejs-20", "web", "postgresql-16"]
run = "npm run dev"
hidden = [".config", ".git", "generated-icon.png", "node_modules", "dist"]
[nix]
channel = "stable-24_05"
packages = ["unzip", "jq"]
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
[env]
PORT = "3000"

[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80

[workflows]
runButton = "Project"

[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Project"
mode = "parallel"
author = "agent"
[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "workflow.run"
args = "Start application"

[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Start application"
author = "agent"
[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "npm run dev"
waitForPort = 3000
[workflows.workflow.metadata]
outputType = "webview"

[agent]
integrations = [
  "javascript_log_in_with_replit:1.0.0",
  "javascript_database:1.0.0",
  "javascript_openai:1.0.0",

[objectStorage]
defaultBucketID = "replit-objstore-e81f8396-1f3e-4539-8815-f5ac8716f43f"
Key changes:

✅ Removed entire "Start Clean" workflow
✅ Removed duplicate PORT = "5000" from userenv
✅ Changed waitForPort from 5000 to 3000 (matches your [env] PORT)
✅ Removed the conflicting [[ports]] localPort = 5000 section

After you save this, restart your project and the port conflicts should be gone forever. Your preview will stay stable when you reload.
