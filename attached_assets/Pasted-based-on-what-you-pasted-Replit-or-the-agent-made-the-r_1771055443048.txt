based on what you pasted, Replit (or the agent) made the right kind of fixes for “constant crashing,” and they’re the exact two fixes I would’ve prioritized.

✅ Fix #1 (server): removing process.exit(1) on unhandled errors

If your server was doing process.exit(1) on uncaughtException / unhandledRejection, that means one random async error can kill the whole backend. That absolutely feels like “the app crashes all the time.”

Changing that to log + keep running is a good fix as long as you also…

✅ Fix #2 (server): making Express catch async route errors

They said you have hundreds of async route handlers, and Express won’t catch thrown async errors unless you:

use express-async-errors, or

wrap handlers manually

Adding express-async-errors is a legit, standard solution and directly prevents unhandled rejections from bubbling to the process-level handler.

So that’s also a good fix.

✅ Fix #3 (frontend/iOS): wrapping unsafe JSON.parse

This is a very common “white screen / reload loop / crashy WebView” issue:

bad localStorage value → JSON.parse throws → React dies

Protecting JSON.parse calls with try/catch (or a safeParse helper) is also a good fix.

The one big caution (important)

A fix like “don’t exit the process” can also hide real bugs if you don’t log/alert properly.

So the fix is good only if you now have:

clear logging of the error + stack

ideally alerting (Sentry, etc.)

and a clean error response (so the client doesn’t spin forever)

If they only removed exits but didn’t ensure you see the errors, you’ll get a “server stays up” but “features randomly don’t work” situation.

How you can tell if it actually fixed your crashes

Two quick reality checks:

Are you actually running the updated code?
If you didn’t redeploy the backend / rebuild the iOS app, you’re still on the old crashy version.

Do the crashes stop or just change form?
If it was server exits: crashes should go way down immediately.
If it was iOS JSON.parse: the “blank screen” should reduce a lot.

Bottom line

From what you pasted: Yes, it was a good fix and it addresses the most common “constant crash” causes in your exact architecture.

If you want, paste the actual code diff for:

where process.exit(1) was removed (server entry)

where express-async-errors was imported

1–2 examples of the JSON.parse changes

…and I’ll tell you if anything was done in a risky way (like swallowing errors silently) or if it’s solid.
