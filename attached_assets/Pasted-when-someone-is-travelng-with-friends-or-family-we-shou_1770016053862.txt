when someone is travelng with friends, or family, we should have an easy connect and maybe some link to friends traveling, how would that work> thoughts?
Thought for 27s

Yeah — this is a great “real life” use case, and you can make it feel effortless without turning Nearby Traveler into a full itinerary app.

Here’s a clean way it could work in Nearby Traveler.

Core concept: “Travel Crew” (aka Trip Group)

When someone creates a trip (city + dates), they can add a Travel Crew: friends/family traveling with them.

What it unlocks immediately

Everyone in the crew is instantly connected (or “linked”) for that trip

A shared group chat for the trip

One-click “Invite the crew to this event” + group RSVP

Optional: shared “Trip Calendar” view (just events you all joined)

The simplest UX flow
1) Create trip → “Are you traveling with anyone?”

Buttons:

Yes — add my crew

No (skip)

2) Add crew in 3 easy ways

Invite link / QR code (best): “Join my trip crew”

Add existing Nearby Traveler friends

Invite by phone/email (they create an account and auto-join that crew)

3) Joining experience

Friend taps link → sees:

Trip name, city, dates

“Join Crew” button

(Optional) “Match my dates” or “My dates are different”

Two modes (important)
A) “Real accounts” (best for friends)

Everyone joins with their own profile → can match with locals/travelers normally.

B) “Companions” (best for kids / non-app family)

Let someone add a companion as a lightweight tag:

“Traveling with: Dad / Sister / 2 kids”

No signup needed

Shows only to the user + crew (or just the user)
This avoids privacy headaches and keeps onboarding friction low.

How it shows up in the product

On a trip page: Crew: 3 people

On profile cards: small indicator like “Traveling with crew” (optional + privacy-controlled)

On events: “Invite crew” / “See who from your crew is going”

In chat: “Trip Crew Chat” pinned at top

Privacy controls you’ll want from day 1

Let the user choose:

Crew visibility: Only crew / Friends / Anyone / Hidden

Location sharing: Off by default; optional “share location with crew during event”

Kids/companions: never public, only visible to the owner

Why this fits your current setup

You already have travel_plans, messages, connections.
This feature can be mostly one new join table:

travel_plan_members (travel_plan_id, user_id, role, joined_at)

optional travel_plan_invites (token, travel_plan_id, invited_contact, status)

Then “Trip Crew Chat” is just messages filtered by travel_plan_id (or a new thread_id).

Extra: “Friends traveling here” (nice discovery)

Once you have crews and travel plans, you can add a lightweight social layer:

“Friends in LA this week” (based on overlapping travel plans)

“Your crew is also going to this event”
