To go viral, Nearby Traveler needs a loop where joining immediately helps you, and sharing helps you even more. Right now your “aha” is: “I found people to do stuff with in this city.” Make that happen in under 60 seconds, then give users a reason to invite.

Make it a no-brainer in the first 60 seconds
1) Instant payoff (no browsing)

After signup → destination city → City Plans

Force the “aha” fast: Pick 3 plans → instantly show “Top 10 matches”

Put a big line at top: “You have 12 people who want to do the same things.”

2) Make City Plans feel like a cheat code

“Pick 3–8 to match faster” (you already have this)

Show “Matches unlocked” after each pick (little animation/count rising)

3) One-tap “Plan + Invite”

Every trip should have:

“Invite friends” button that creates a share link

The share link lands people directly into that same city/trip context

The viral loops that actually work for you
Loop A: Trip link loop (best)

“I’m going to LA Feb 2–6. Join my City Plans.”

Share link auto-fills destination + dates

Friends join to see your plans / join events / message

Loop B: Event loop (second best)

When a user creates an event (or adds one):

It generates a share card: “3 people going • join us”

Sharing brings new users who care about that specific event

Loop C: “Match screenshot” loop (social proof)

Let users share a clean graphic:

“Found 9 matches for ‘Comedy + Street Food + Museums’ in LA”
This is braggy and natural to post.

Make invites feel worth it

People won’t invite just to “help you grow.” Give them a selfish reason:

Unlock features: “Invite 3 people → unlock ‘See who’s free tonight’”

Better matching: “More people in your city = more matches”

Status: “Founding Traveler / LA Founder badge” (limited)

Your “viral CTA” should be everywhere

Add a single button that appears after the first match:
“Create a plan & invite someone”
Not “share the app.” Share a specific plan.

What I’d do this week (practical)

Add “Share Trip” link with deep link to City Plans

Add “Matches unlocked” counter after each pick

Add shareable card (image) for Trip + Event + Match count

Add simple referral reward: “Invite 3 → unlock premium filter for 7 days”
