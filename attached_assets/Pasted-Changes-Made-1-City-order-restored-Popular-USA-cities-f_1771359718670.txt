Changes Made
1. City order restored
Popular USA cities first: Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Austin, Chicago, New York City
Then LA metro cities: Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Venice, etc.
Then the rest in the original order (no alphabetical sort)
2. Popular countries first
Countries like United States, UK, Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, etc. are listed first
Remaining countries follow in alphabetical order
3. Popular states first
States like California, New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, Illinois, Washington, etc. are listed first
Other states follow in alphabetical order
4. Search bar added
Each modal (Country, State, City) now has a search bar at the top
Tapping it opens the keyboard on iOS
Type to filter (e.g. "F" for France, "CA" for California, "Miami" for Miami)
Options update as you type
How to use the search on iOS:
Open Country, State, or City
Tap the search bar at the top
Type to filter (e.g. "F" → France, "Aus" → Austin or Australia)
Tap an option to select it
this was already in replit and working fine for months, did you just pullthe wrng code?

I don’t have access to Replit or your deployed app. I can only see what’s in your local workspace.
From what’s in the repo, it looks like things changed when the code was synced to use shared/locationData.ts as the single source of truth. That likely:
Replaced the old location data (popular-first ordering, etc.) with the shared version
Introduced the .sort() in expo-app/src/constants/locationData.js that put US cities in alphabetical order
Left the Expo LocationPicker without a search bar (only a scroll list)
So the “wrong” part wasn’t pulling from the wrong place; it was that the sync to shared overwrote the previous, working setup.
If the working version is still on Replit, you can:
Compare the Replit files with your local ones (e.g. expo-app/src/constants/locationData.js, expo-app/src/components/LocationPicker.js, client/src/lib/locationData.ts)
Copy the working versions from Replit into your local project
Or Revert the sync-related commits and restore the old location data
The changes I made were to approximate that old behavior (popular-first, search bar) using the current codebase. If you can grab the original files from Replit, using those directly would be the most accurate way to restore the previous behavior.
