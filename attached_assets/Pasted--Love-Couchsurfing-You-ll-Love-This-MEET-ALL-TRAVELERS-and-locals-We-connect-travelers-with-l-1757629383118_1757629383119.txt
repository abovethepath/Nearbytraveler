## FOR EXPERIENCED HOSTS

**We Know You Love Hosting**  
If you've hosted before, you know the magic: meeting fascinating people, sharing your city, learning about new cultures. But hosting can sometimes just not be possible with work or family life. That doesn't mean you're less generous — it just means life changes. With Nearby Traveler, you can keep the spirit of meaningful connections alive in a way that works for you today.

**Beyond the Couch**  
Open to all travelers — whether you're hosting, have your own place, or staying elsewhere. Nearby Traveler helps you meet people through shared interests, activities, events, and genuine compatibility.

- **Match by what you love** — Interests and activities
- **Headed to the same events** — See who's also going to Taylor Swift, Comic-Con, SXSW, and more
- **Meet your way** — Coffee, hikes, shows, markets, bars, the beach
- **Real moments, not just messages** — Share hidden gems and build experiences together
- **Total flexibility** — Connect when you want—hosting or not
- **Short on time while hosting?** — Point guests to Nearby Traveler so they can meet others in town

**Sometimes We Just Grow Out of It**  
You're not less generous. You're not less welcoming. Life evolves, priorities shift, and that's completely normal. You can still share your love for your city—just differently.

**The Best of Both Worlds**  
Host when your schedule allows. Meet travelers when hosting isn't possible. Your generosity and love for authentic connections never has to stop.

## FOR EXPERIENCED SURFERS

**We Know You've Loved Surfing**  
If you've surfed before, you know the magic: authentic local insights, genuine connections, and the thrill of discovering a place through someone else's eyes. But finding the right hosts and navigating unpredictable situations can be challenging. With Nearby Traveler, you can keep that authentic travel spirit alive with more options and fewer limitations.

**Connect with 100% of Travelers**  
Couchsurfing's hangouts feature was brilliant for last-minute connections. We've expanded that concept — now reach ALL travelers in your city:

- **Hotel & Airbnb Travelers** — Connect with travelers who have accommodation but want authentic local experiences
- **Visiting Friends & Family** — Meet travelers staying with locals who want to expand their social circle  
- **Solo Travelers** — Connect with independent travelers seeking authentic local experiences during their journey
- **Digital Nomads** — Meet remote workers and long-term travelers who want community connections

## From Your Fellow Couchsurfer

*"I've hosted 400+ travelers from 50+ countries over 15 years. The magic is the connections, the stories, the late-night conversations about life. I created Nearby Traveler because I realized I couldn't always host, but I always wanted to meet travelers. Now you can keep that spirit alive, whether you have space or not."*
