Scrollbar shrinking = Radix thinks the dialog is open (it’s locking scroll), so we’re not dealing with “click didn’t fire.” We’re dealing with “open happens, but content never becomes visible on desktop.”

Given your screenshot + “mobile works, desktop doesn’t,” the most common real cause is:

✅ The desktop trigger is inside a Dropdown/Popover/Menu (or a branch that unmounts)

On desktop, your “Edit Profile” button is usually in a header area / dropdown menu. When you click it:

the menu closes / unmounts

that same interaction is treated as outside click

the dialog either closes immediately or the component holding the dialog gets unmounted

result: you see only the scrollbar shift (open/close side-effect), but no content

This is extremely common with Radix components.

Fix that works reliably (do this even if you keep uncontrolled Trigger)
1) Keep the <Dialog> mounted OUTSIDE any dropdown/popover

Put the dialog near the end of your page/component JSX so it’s always present (not inside menus, cards, conditional branches):

// at top
const [isEditMode, setIsEditMode] = useState(false);

// ...buttons anywhere call setIsEditMode(true)

{/* render this once, outside dropdowns/popovers */}
<Dialog open={isEditMode} onOpenChange={setIsEditMode}>
  <DialogContent className="max-w-[95vw] w-full md:max-w-2xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
    ...
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>

2) If the desktop trigger is in a DropdownMenuItem, use onSelect + prevent default

Do NOT use onClick inside Radix DropdownMenuItem.

<DropdownMenuItem
  onSelect={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // key: open AFTER the menu finishes closing
    setTimeout(() => setIsEditMode(true), 0);
  }}
>
  Edit Profile
</DropdownMenuItem>


That setTimeout(..., 0) is the secret sauce when a menu is involved.

If it’s a normal <Button> inside a popover/menu, do this:

<Button
  type="button"
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    setTimeout(() => setIsEditMode(true), 0);
  }}
>
  Edit Profile
</Button>

Quick “is it immediately closing?” proof (no guessing)

Add this temporarily:

<Dialog
  open={isEditMode}
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    console.log("Dialog onOpenChange:", open);
    setIsEditMode(open);
  }}
>
  <DialogContent
    onInteractOutside={(e) => console.log("InteractOutside")}
    onPointerDownOutside={(e) => console.log("PointerDownOutside")}
  >


If you see PointerDownOutside right after clicking desktop → yep, it’s opening then closing due to the menu/outside interaction.

Why your “pure uncontrolled” test can still fail on desktop

Even if you go fully <DialogTrigger>, if that trigger lives inside a DropdownMenu/Popover, the parent will still close/unmount and you get the same symptom: scrollbar shift, no visible dialog.

Do this now

Find where the desktop edit button lives. If it’s inside any of these: DropdownMenu, Popover, Sheet, Menubar, ContextMenu — apply the onSelect + setTimeout pattern and move the <Dialog> outside.

If you paste the JSX around the desktop button (like 20–40 lines showing whether it’s inside a DropdownMenu/Popover), I’ll tell you the exact edit to make with no back-and-forth.
