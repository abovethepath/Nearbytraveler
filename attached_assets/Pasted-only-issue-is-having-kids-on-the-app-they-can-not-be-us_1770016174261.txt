only issue is having kids on the app, they can not be users
Thought for 12s

Totally workable — you just model kids as companions, not users. Adults have accounts; kids never do.

Here’s a clean way to make “traveling with family” feel easy in Nearby Traveler without kids becoming users:

The pattern: “Travel Crew” + “Companions”
Adults = real users

Can connect, message, RSVP, join chats, etc.

Kids = companions (no account, no login)

They’re attached to a parent/guardian’s trip as “+1 / child”

They’re not searchable, not messageable, and never appear as profiles

UX: how it works in the app
1) Trip setup: “Traveling with anyone?”

Buttons:

Add friends (Nearby Traveler users)

Add companions (no account)

2) Add companions (kid-safe)

When parent taps “Add companions,” you collect only minimal info:

Label: “Kid 1”, “Sophie” (optional nickname)

Age bracket (recommended instead of exact age): 0–4, 5–9, 10–13, 14–17

Optional notes private to parent/crew: allergies, stroller-friendly, bedtime, etc.

Default setting: Companions are private (only visible to the parent + optionally the adult crew).

3) Events: “Invite crew” still works

When RSVP’ing, the parent chooses:

Adults going (actual users)

Companions going (Kid 1, Kid 2)

Event card can show something like:

“Going: 3 adults + 2 kids”
…but never identifies kids publicly.

4) Chat: adults only

The “Trip Crew Chat” includes only adult users.
Parents can still coordinate everything; kids never enter messaging.

“Friends traveling” still works (without exposing kids)

You can still show:

“Your friends are in LA this week”

“2 friends are going to this event”

But never: “X is traveling with 2 kids” publicly (that’s a safety risk). At most, inside the private crew: “Aaron added 2 companions.”

Safety defaults that make this defensible

No child accounts

No child photos

No child profile fields (email, phone, socials = never)

No public display of kids

No location sharing for companions (ever)

If you ever add location sharing for adults, keep it crew-only and opt-in

(Also: keep child-related notes private and minimal—avoid storing sensitive details you don’t truly need.)

Implementation (small + clean)

You can do this with two small tables:

companions

id

owner_user_id

label (e.g., “Kid 1”)

age_bracket (enum)

notes_private (optional)

created_at

travel_plan_members

travel_plan_id

user_id (nullable)

companion_id (nullable)

role (owner/admin/member)

constraint: exactly one of user_id or companion_id is set

Messages stay the same (adults only).

The “easy connect” part for families

On the trip page:

Invite adult partner (link/QR)

Add companions (kids)

Share itinerary/events to crew

One-tap RSVP for “me + companions”

This gives families the frictionless experience you want, without ever making children users.

If you tell me where you want this to appear first (trip creation flow vs profile vs event RSVP), I’ll write the exact UI copy and the minimal screens/components to build next.
