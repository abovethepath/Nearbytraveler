Got it. This screenshot is the smoking gun — and it has nothing to do with Starter vs Standard.

✅ Your backend is connected to a database that does not match your code’s schema

Render logs:

Error updating travel statuses: column "destination_city" does not exist
code: 42703

That means: your code is running a query that expects a destination_city column, but the database your Render DATABASE_URL points to doesn’t have it.

When your app boots, it’s trying to run TravelStatusService.updateAllUserTravelStatuses(...) and it’s hitting that DB error. That alone can make the app feel “broken/slow,” and login can fail too if auth hits other missing columns.

Where you go from here (slow + exact steps)
Step 1 — Decide which database Render should use (fastest fix)

Fastest fix is usually: Render must point to the SAME Neon DB/branch you used on Replit.

Do this now:

In Replit → Secrets → copy the exact DATABASE_URL you’ve been developing with.

In Render → Environment → replace DATABASE_URL with that exact value.

Redeploy (Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy)

If your Replit DB already has the right schema, this fixes it immediately.

Step 2 — If you want Render to use this current DB, you must apply migrations

If you intentionally pointed Render at a different Neon DB/branch, then you need to push your schema to it.

The quickest way to do that without guessing:

Open your repo package.json → look at "scripts" for something like:

db:push

db:migrate

migrate

drizzle:push

drizzle:migrate

Then run it once on Render:
Render → Shell, run one of these (whichever exists):

npm run db:push


or

npm run db:migrate


Then redeploy.

If you don’t have any migration script, we’ll add one—because that’s exactly why a new environment breaks.

Step 3 — Stop the travel-status monitor from hammering the broken query (temporary relief)

Your log literally says “travel status monitoring enabled” and then it crashes trying to read destination_city.

Even before you fix schema, you can prevent the app from thrashing by gating that feature:

In the code where it starts travel status monitoring / initial travel status check, wrap it like:

if (process.env.ENABLE_TRAVEL_STATUS_MONITOR === "true") {
  // start monitoring
}


Then on Render set:

ENABLE_TRAVEL_STATUS_MONITOR=false (or just don’t set it)

This isn’t the real fix — it just stops the repeated error spam while we fix the DB.

What I need from you (one simple choice)

Which of these is true?

A) “I want Render using the exact same Neon DB as Replit”

→ Then do Step 1 and we’re probably done.

B) “I want Render using a different Neon DB/branch”

→ Then tell me what DB scripts you have in package.json (paste the scripts block), and I’ll tell you the exact one to run + where to put it (Shell vs Pre-Deploy Command).

Also: your screenshot earlier showed secrets exposed. After this is stable, rotate REDIS_URL and SESSION_SECRET (because they were visible).
