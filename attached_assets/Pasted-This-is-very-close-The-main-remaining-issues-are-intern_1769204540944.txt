This is very close. The main remaining issues are internal contradictions + a couple missing “contract” pieces that Replit will otherwise invent.

Must-fix contradictions (copy/paste edits)
1) You still reference /api/bootstrap/status as “profile completion” in KEY ENDPOINTS

Right now you say (correctly) it’s not profile completion — but later you still list it as “Check profile completion.”

Fix:

Change this line under KEY API ENDPOINTS → Auth
GET /api/bootstrap/status - Check profile completion
to:
GET /api/bootstrap/status - Welcome/bootstrap operations only (NOT profile completion)

2) Home Discovery uses /api/users in some places, but you also say Home should use /api/search-users

You updated the appendix (good), but earlier sections + smoke test still point Home to /api/users.

Fix (choose one and be consistent):

In CORE FEATURES → Home Page / Discovery, change:
API: GET /api/users, POST /api/connections/degrees/batch
to:
API: GET /api/search-users (recommended for Home), POST /api/connections/degrees/batch

In Phase 1 Smoke Test, change:
Home tab → GET /api/users
to:
Home tab → GET /api/search-users?location=<hometownCity>

3) Chatrooms: you say “Auto-joins chatrooms” but you also rely on userIsMember: true/false

Those two statements conflict.

Fix (recommended wording):
Replace this bullet in “Automatic Signup Flow”:

Assigns user to chatrooms - Auto-joins hometown + destination chatrooms

With:

Chatrooms list is auto-populated - /api/chatrooms/my-locations includes hometown + ALL upcoming destination cities immediately (endDate >= today). Response includes userIsMember true/false for highlighting.

(That keeps your earlier backend behavior consistent.)

Missing “core contract” pieces (will cause Replit to guess)
4) How do you SEND a city chatroom message?

You only document:

GET /api/chatrooms/:chatroomId (read)

But there’s no REST endpoint or WebSocket message shape for posting a chatroom message. Replit will invent one.

Add one of these (whichever matches your backend):

Option A (WebSocket): add message type + payload

type: "chatroom_message"

fields: { chatroomId, senderId, content, timestamp }

Option B (REST): add endpoint

POST /api/chatrooms/:chatroomId/messages { content }

If you don’t add this, group chat won’t be buildable.

5) Connection Requests screen needs an API shape

You map /requests to a mobile screen, but your API list doesn’t tell the builder how to fetch pending requests.

If your existing GET /api/connections/:userId already returns pending + accepted, explicitly say so and provide a sample shape (with status: pending|accepted|rejected, direction: incoming|outgoing).

If not, add the endpoint you actually use, e.g.:

GET /api/connections/requests (incoming/outgoing)

6) Account deletion: you promise the button but no endpoint

You list “Delete Account” screen and “Account deletion request button,” but there’s no API endpoint for it.

Add the real one (whatever exists on your backend), for example:

DELETE /api/users/:id
or

POST /api/support/account-delete

Small but important clarifiers (prevents subtle bugs)
7) City stats: define counts as unique users, not trips

Right now travelerCount could be interpreted as “trip count.” Add one line:

All counts are unique users (deduped by userId), not number of trips.

8) Deals + Nearby: mark display-only string fields

You already added safety rules—nice. Add two lines so builders don’t try to parse strings:

Deals: expiresIn is display-only; use validUntil for countdown/timers.

Nearby: approximateDistance is display-only (string); do not parse to compute distance.

9) Add quick-deals and nearby endpoints to the KEY API ENDPOINTS list

Right now they appear in the appendix, but make sure they’re also in the “KEY API ENDPOINTS” section so Replit doesn’t miss them:

GET /api/quick-deals?city=...

GET /api/users/nearby?lat&lng&radiusKm=...

If you apply the 6 “must-fix / missing contract” items above, this prompt becomes genuinely builder-proof (no guessing on chatrooms, requests, home discovery, or delete account).
