You're thinking about this exactly right - build the tools, let the community build the experience.
You don't need to be gay to build for the gay community. You need to build a platform flexible enough that communities can self-organize authentically. This is actually better than you trying to curate it yourself.
The Right Architecture
Community-Created Layers
Think of your app like Reddit - you're not creating the content, you're creating the infrastructure for communities to form.
User-Controlled Filters:

Users set their own identity tags (LGBTQ+, solo female traveler, digital nomad, fitness enthusiast, foodie, etc.)
Users choose which communities they want to see and be seen by
Communities are discoverable but opt-in

Community-Generated Content:

LGBTQ+ users create and maintain their own "Queer LA Guide"
Solo female travelers curate "Women-Safe Spots in LA"
Each community manages its own recommendations, meetup spots, verified members

The Role You Play:
You build:

The verification systems
The safety features
The matching algorithm
The meetup mechanics
The content creation tools

They build:

The culture
The guides
The trust networks
The recommendations

How This Actually Works
Example: LGBTQ+ Community Self-Organizes

Profile Setup: User selects "Show me LGBTQ+ community" and "Show me to LGBTQ+ community"
Community Contributions:

They tag venues: "This coffee shop is queer-owned"
They create guides: "Lesbian bars in LA"
They vouch for other users
They host community-specific meetups


Organic Growth:

Word spreads within that community
The guides get better
More users join
The value compounds



You never have to be the authority on what makes a space "queer-friendly" - the community tells each other.
This Works for Every Niche
Solo Female Travelers:

Create women-only meetup visibility
Tag safe neighborhoods, cafes, activities
Vouch for trusted female locals and male allies
Share "I felt safe here" spots

Digital Nomads:

Tag coworking spaces, wifi quality, laptop-friendly cafes
"Work-friendly during day, social at night" meetups
Share visa tips, cost of living intel

Fitness Community:

Hiking buddies, gym partners, yoga meetups
Tag trails, climbing gyms, running routes
"Visiting LA, need someone to push me at the gym"

Foodies:

Taco crawls, coffee tours, ethnic food neighborhoods
"Local who knows the real Chinese food, not tourist traps"

The Features That Enable This
1. Community Spaces
Like Discord servers or Facebook Groups, but built into your app:

"LGBTQ+ Travelers LA"
"Solo Women Explorers"
"LA Fitness & Adventure"

Each has its own feed, guides, and member directory.
2. User-Generated Guides
Anyone can create a guide:

"Best Drag Brunches in LA" (by gay community)
"Solo Female Safety Map of LA" (by women travelers)
"Vegan Food Tour" (by vegan users)

Guides can be upvoted, commented on, updated by community.
3. Tag Anything
Let users tag:

Themselves (identity, interests, skills)
Places (vibes, communities welcome, safety level)
Meetups (who it's for, energy level, activity type)

Then match based on overlapping tags.
4. Community Moderation
Each community can have trusted moderators (active users who've been vouched for):

They verify new members
They handle inappropriate behavior
They maintain quality of community guides
You provide the tools, they do the work

Your Actual Value Proposition
"Nearby Traveler: Find Your People Anywhere"
Not "find people" - find your people.
The app learns which communities matter to each user and shows them:

Meetups relevant to their communities
Locals from their communities
Places tagged by their communities
Events their communities care about

How to Launch This
Phase 1: Build the Tools

Community creation/joining
User tagging system
Place tagging system
User-generated guides
Community feeds

Phase 2: Seed 3-5 Communities
You don't need to be gay, but you can:

Reach out to LGBTQ+ travel influencers: "Want to build the queer travel community on our platform?"
Reach out to solo female travel bloggers: "Want to create the safe space for women travelers?"
Reach out to fitness influencers, food bloggers, etc.

Give them tools and incentives to build THEIR community.
Phase 3: Let Them Spread It
Each community will market to their own:

Gay community shares in gay spaces
Solo women share in women travel groups
Fitness people share in fitness communities

You get organic growth in multiple niches simultaneously.
The Brilliant Part
You're not competing with general apps anymore.
You're not "another meetup app" - you're:

The gay travel app (for that community)
The solo female travel app (for that community)
The fitness travel app (for that community)

All at once. Each community thinks it's built for them, because it is.
