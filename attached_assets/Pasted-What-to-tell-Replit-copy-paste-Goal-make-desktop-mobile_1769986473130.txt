What to tell Replit (copy/paste)

Goal: make desktop + mobile use the same Dialog + Trigger, not two separate versions.

The “Edit Profile” dialog works only on mobile width. On desktop, clicking does nothing. This likely means there are two different Edit buttons rendered by responsive classes (e.g., md:hidden / hidden md:flex) and the desktop one isn’t connected to the Dialog or its click is blocked.

Please do this:

Search the codebase for “Edit Profile” (and also md:hidden, hidden md: near it).
If there are two Edit buttons (mobile + desktop), delete one and keep ONE trigger shared across all sizes.

Implement the Edit button like this (single trigger; text changes by breakpoint):

<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button type="button" className="...">
      <Pencil className="h-4 w-4" />
      <span className="hidden md:inline">Edit Profile</span>
    </Button>
  </DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent className="z-[9999]">
    ...
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>


Ensure the dialog content is portaled (shadcn default). Don’t render DialogContent inside a container that has transform or overflow:hidden without a portal.

Add a temporary debug to confirm desktop click fires:

<Button type="button" onClick={() => console.log("EDIT CLICK")} ... />


If desktop logs don’t show, something is blocking clicks (overlay/div/pointer-events).

If the overlay opens (scrollbar disappears) but the dialog is invisible on desktop, raise z-index:

DialogOverlay: z-[9998]

DialogContent: z-[9999]

After this, desktop must open the same dialog as mobile.

Quick self-check (30 seconds)

On desktop, open DevTools → Elements → press Ctrl+F and search for:

data-radix-portal right after clicking Edit

or look for a new node like .DialogOverlay / .DialogContent

If you see a portal appear: the dialog is opening but is hidden/behind something (z-index/CSS).
If you see nothing new: the desktop button click isn’t firing (two-button breakpoint issue or click blocked).

If you paste one snippet, I’ll pinpoint it

Paste the ~40 lines where the Edit button + Dialog is defined (the part that contains Edit Profile), and I’ll tell you exactly which line is breaking desktop (it’s usually a hidden md:* duplicate trigger or a mixed controlled/uncontrolled Dialog setup).
