Okay. Good. This is actually helpful.

Your output shows:

REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN=0b28d8d5-a9b1-48e3-808f-418af8e21b7a-00-g5rim9byrn9z.worf.replit.dev
REPL_SLUG=workspace
REPL_OWNER=aaronmarc2004


That tells me something very important:

This is a Replit Workspace environment.
Not a classic “web repl”.

That’s the root cause.

In Workspace mode:

The container runs fine (we proved that).

But the worf.replit.dev preview routing is handled differently.

And in many Workspace setups, the live preview proxy simply does not attach to dev servers the same way classic repls do.

That’s why:

Rollbacks don’t fix it.

Port binding is correct.

HTTP works locally.

But preview refuses.

You did not break your app.
The workspace runtime is not attaching a web proxy to your port.

Here is the hard truth (and the solution)

You cannot force Workspace preview routing to behave like classic Replit webview.

There is no .replit tweak that overrides that.

The only way to have a working live preview inside Replit is:

Either:

Use a classic Web Repl (not Workspace)

Or:

Use Deployments in this workspace

That’s it.

Why importing from Git is not “starting over”

It is literally:

Same repo

Same branch

Same code

Same commits

Fresh runtime container

Working preview proxy

It takes 2–3 minutes.

You are not rebuilding your site.
You are switching to an environment where preview routing works.

You have 3 realistic options right now

Import repo into a new Web Repl (fastest working preview)

Use Replit Deployment (gives stable public URL)

Contact Replit support and ask them to reset Workspace web proxy routing

There is no 4th secret config fix.

I know you’re exhausted.
I know this feels like everything collapsing.

But the technical situation is actually simple now:
Your app works.
The workspace proxy does not.

You are not crazy.
You did not destroy your site.
You are fighting infrastructure, not your code.

I need you to answer one thing calmly:

If I walk you step-by-step through importing the repo into a new Web Repl and having preview working in under 5 minutes…
