Nice — your screenshot shows you’re in Luma → Calendars and right now it says “No Calendars”. So the next move is simple: create the official NT calendar(s), then embed that calendar on your LA City Events page.

Step 1 (in Luma): Create your first calendar

Click + Create (top right on that page)

Name it something that feels like a product, not “Aaron’s events”:

Nearby Traveler — Los Angeles (Official)

Make sure it’s public (so it can be embedded/shared)

Add a short description like:

“Official meetups for locals + travelers in LA. RSVP to meet people with shared interests.”

Step 2: Create 3–5 “anchor” LA events

Do a few recurring formats so it doesn’t look random:

Sunday Sunset Meetup (Westside)

Coffee + Co-work (weekday morning)

Hike + Brunch

New in LA / Visiting LA Meetup

International Night

In each event:

Put “Hosted by Nearby Traveler” in the title/host line

Add 3–6 tags in the description (Beach, Hiking, Coffee, Networking, etc.)

Add a strong first-line CTA: “Say hi in chat before you come.”

Step 3: Turn on the social proof inside Luma

For each event, enable:

Guest list visibility (so people can see who’s going)

Event Chat (start it early and pin a message like: “Introduce yourself + where you’re from”)

That solves your exact worry: “If they RSVP on Luma, nobody knows others are going.” On Luma, they’ll literally see the list + chat.

Step 4 (Nearby Traveler): Embed the LA calendar on the LA City Events page

This is the key: even without the API, your LA page looks alive.

What you’ll do in your React page:

Add a section: Official LA Events

Embed the Luma calendar (iframe or Luma’s embed snippet)

Under it add buttons:

Create an Event (NT flow)

View on Luma / RSVP (opens Luma event)

If you want the embed to feel native, wrap it in your card UI and set a fixed height with internal scrolling.

Step 5: Make it not show for every city

Only render the embed when:

City = Los Angeles
So it doesn’t feel like “random LA stuff” for someone browsing NYC.

Quick question (so I can tell you the exact next click)

When you create the calendar, do you see an “Embed” option in Luma (calendar settings/share)?
If you screenshot that calendar “Share/Embed” screen, I’ll tell you exactly which embed type to use and how to drop it into your LA city events page without breaking mobile scrolling.

wait so this is for actual events I am going to create myself?

Yes.

If you’re using your own Luma account without the API, then what we’re talking about is:

👉 You hosting actual events
👉 Luma handling RSVPs + guest list + chat
👉 Nearby Traveler promoting and wrapping those events

That’s the cleanest version right now.

Important mindset shift

Right now, Luma is not your event marketplace feed.

It’s your event operations tool.

Nearby Traveler is:

discovery

matching

city community

identity layer

Luma is:

RSVP

reminders

guest list

check-in

So yes — this calendar would be:

Nearby Traveler – Los Angeles (Official)
And the events would be things you (or ambassadors) are actually hosting.

That’s actually powerful for you because:

You’re already strong at:

organizing networking events

hosting communities

activating people

You’ve done 400+ Couchsurfing hosts.
This is your unfair advantage.

Here’s the real strategic question:

Do you want Nearby Traveler to:

Aggregate other people’s events
OR

Become known for hosting high-quality curated meetups?

Because those are two different plays.

Right now, with no Luma API, the strongest play is:

Be the curator + host in LA first.

That gives you:

real photos

real testimonials

real traction

real stories for investors

real engagement metrics

That’s way more valuable than scraping random events.

If you don’t want to personally host everything

You can:

Create the calendar

Give ambassadors co-host access

Let them create events under the NT brand

Now it becomes:
“Official Nearby Traveler LA Events”

Not “Aaron’s networking events.”

Let me ask you something important:

Are you trying to:
A) Fill the LA events page with activity quickly
or
B) Build a long-term scalable event ingestion system?

Because your answer changes what we build next.

oh but i have all that integrated int nearby traveler now, chatrooms created for each event etc

Perfect — if NT already creates the event + chatroom, then Luma should be optional plumbing, not the source of truth.

Make Nearby Traveler the source of truth

Create event in Nearby Traveler → chatroom auto-created (you already have this)

Then optionally attach a Luma RSVP link to that NT event

So the event “lives” in NT, and Luma is just the RSVP/guestlist engine.

What you can do with Luma (without API) that still fits your setup
1) Add a “RSVP on Luma” link field to NT events

Add 2 fields to your events table:

externalRsvpUrl (string)

externalProvider (“luma” | “partiful” | null)

Then your event page shows:

Primary: Join Chat (NT)

Secondary: RSVP on Luma (opens Luma)

This keeps your community + conversation inside NT.

2) Use Luma only for “Official” / high-stakes events

For example:

big meetups

paid events

venue-cap events

check-in needed

Everything else can stay NT-native.

3) Keep Luma in sync manually (fast + realistic)

Without API, you’re not syncing attendance automatically. But you don’t need to for MVP.

Workflow:

Create event in NT

Create matching Luma event

Paste Luma URL into NT event

4) If you want social proof inside NT without syncing

Add an NT button like:

“I’m going” (NT attendance)
That powers:

attendee count

attendee list (NT users)

“Friends going”

your chatroom growth

Luma remains the “official RSVP” if you need it.

What NOT to do

Don’t make Luma your calendar feed/embedded page if NT is already your event system — that creates duplication and confusion.

The clean LA City Events page structure

List NT events (your DB)

Each card can optionally show a small badge:

“RSVP required” (Luma)

Event detail page:

Join Chat

RSVP on Luma (if present)

If you want, paste your current event schema (or the Event type/interface) and I’ll tell you exactly where to add the 2 fields + what the UI should look like so it’s dead simple and doesn’t mess up mobile.
