Why Nearby Traveler
Connect Before You Go
Meet locals and travelers before your trip starts — no more wandering alone in new cities.
Discover Hidden Gems
Access authentic spots locals actually love, not tourist traps from guidebooks.
Stay Connected Globally
Get notified when friends from past trips are in your next destination.
Create & Join Local Events
Host experiences in your city or join authentic local gatherings anywhere.

From the Founder
"After hosting 400+ travelers from 50 countries, I learned that one connection can change everything. Travelers spend billions on flights and hotels, yet the most valuable part — the people you meet — is left to chance. I built the solution I wished existed."
— Aaron Lefkowitz, Founder
