# iOS Build Scope — Prefer iOS changes first

When making changes to this codebase, **prefer** modifying files that affect the iOS build first (native wrapper / mobile integration). Website changes are allowed when explicitly requested.

## Allowed (iOS build only)

- `ios-app/` — iOS native wrapper
- `capacitor-app/` — Capacitor mobile wrapper
- `expo-app/` — React Native / Expo mobile app
- `capacitor.config.ts` — Capacitor configuration
- Root `package.json` — only scripts/deps related to iOS/Capacitor/Expo builds

## Website paths (allowed when requested)

- `client/` — React web app (pages, components, routing, etc.)
- `server/` — Express backend, API routes, services
- `shared/` — Database schema, shared constants
- `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts` — web build config
- `migrations/` — database migrations

## If a change can be fixed iOS-side

Prefer iOS-side fixes when they solve the problem cleanly (e.g., WebView/session/bridge issues). If not, proceed with the website change that was requested.
